When you were first born, and starting to learn about the world, if I showed you the following stars: * * *, and told you there are three stars, then this might not make any sense to you These definitions are rooted in your very existance, as humans most things we do require intermediate steps to complete, for example you are reading the middle of this paragraph, as an intermediate step to completly reading this paragraph, which you have now done. Good job :) Most actions that humans do require intermediate steps in order to complete the action, in the english language this relationship is written as an "if X then Y" statement which allows us to write something like if (the intermediate steps are completed) then (I can complete this action). If you noticed in the first part of the previous paragraph I used the words "in order", which is pretty much equivalent to "if X then Y", so the only real way to understand these words is to have them repeated over time with real world examples until meaning is bound to the sequence of words.
