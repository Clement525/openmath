    	</div>
<div class="proof">
<p>
                Let \( n \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \), recall that \( \left( n \right) _ \diamond = \mathbb{ Z } n \) and by definition we know that \( \mathbb{ Z } n = \left\{ k n : k \in \mathbb{ Z }  \right\}  \), which we can think of as all multiples of \( n \). Now then \( \mathbb{ Z }  / \left( n \right) _ \diamond = \left\{ s + \left( a \right) _ \diamond : s \in \mathbb{ Z } \right\} \), for some fixed \( s \in \mathbb{ Z }  \) we can see that \( s + \left( n \right) _ \diamond = \left\{ s + k \cdot n : k \in \mathbb{ Z }   \right\}  \)
            </p>
<p>
                We'll start by showing that the two sets are equal, so let \( X \in \mathbb{ Z } / \left( n \right) _ \diamond  \) then \( X = \left\{ s + k n : k \in \mathbb{ Z }  \right\}  \) for some \( s \in \mathbb{ Z }  \), now consider the equivalence class \( \overline{ s }  \), it is defined as all elements in \( \mathbb{ Z }  \) who all share the same remainder as \( s \) upon division by \( n \), as previously seen it turns out that this set is equal to \( \left\{ s + k n : k \in \mathbb{ Z }  \right\}  \) but this is exactly \( X \), as needed.
            </p>
<p>
                Now suppose that we have some \( \overline{ k } \in \mathbb{ Z } _ n ^ \%  \), as just discussed we know that \( \overline{ k } = \left\{ k + jn : n \in \mathbb{ Z }  \right\}  \) which is the coset \( s + \left( n \right) _ \diamond \in \mathbb{ Z } / \left( n \right) _ \diamond  \). Thus at this point we concluded that as sets, we have \( \mathbb{ Z } _ n ^ \% = \mathbb{ Z } //  \left( n \right) _ \diamond  \)
            </p>
<p>
                Suppose that \( \overline{ a } , \overline{ b } \in \mathbb{ Z } _ n ^ \%   \) then \( \overline{a} \oplus \overline{ b } = \overline{ a + b } \), but at the same time \( \overline{ a } = a + \left( n \right) _ \diamond \) and \( \overline{ b } = b + \left( n \right) _ \diamond \) and we have \( \left( a + \left( n \right) _ \diamond \right) \boxplus \left( b + \left( n \right) _ \diamond \right) = \left( \left( a + b \right) + \left( n \right) _ \diamond \right)    \) which shows us that their addition operations are the same because \( \overline{ a + b } = \left( a + b \right) + \left( n \right) _ \diamond \), it's similarly noted that their multiplications are the same by replacing respective plusses with the times symbol.
            </p>
<p>
                Therefore given these two rings, both of their sets are equal and their operations are equal, so they are actually the same ring.

                </li>
</ul>

<div class="proof">
<p>
                To find a polynomial with the same remainder we first do things via long division:

<div class="centered-content">
<img alt="" src="polynomial_long_division.png"/>
</div>
<p>
                Therefore the polynomial \( - 2 x ^ 3 - 35136x + 3 \) is congruent modulo \( x ^ 4 - 16 \), because they both have the same remainder upon division by \( x ^ 4 - 16 \) .
            </p>
<p>
                Recall the definition of a <a class="knowledge-link" href="/algebra/galois_theory/rings.html#definition-zero-divisor">zero divisor</a>, note that \( 0 \) in this quotient ring is simply the polynomial with all coefficients set to \( 0 \in \mathbb{ Z }  \), therefore we can clearly see that \( x - 2, x + 2 \) have at least one non-zero coefficient therefore they cannot be zero elements. Now at the same time we can factor \( x ^ 4 - 16 = \left( x ^ 2 - 4 \right) \left( x ^ 2 + 4 \right) = \left( x - 2 \right) \left( x + 2 \right) \left( x ^ 2 + 4 \right)   \). We get two equations from this : \( \left( x - 2 \right) \left( x ^ 3 + 2 x ^ 2 + 4x + 8  \right)  \) and \( \left( x + 2 \right) \left( x ^ 3 - 2x ^ 2 + 4 x - 8 \right)   \), since we can verify that \( x ^ 3 - 2 x ^ 2 + 4 x - 8 , x ^ 3 + 2 x ^ 2 + 4 x + 8 \) are both non-zero polynomials,


                then so far we can conclude that \( x - 2, x + 2 \)

<p>
                Now notice that \( x ^ 4 - 16 + \left( x ^ 4 - 16 \right) _ \diamond  = 0 + \left( x ^ 4 - 16  \right) _ \diamond \). For convience set \( I = \left( x ^ 4 - 16 \right) _ \diamond  \) So then we have that \( \left[ x - 2 + I \right]  \left[ x ^ 3 + 2 x ^ 2+ 4 x + 8 + I \right] = x ^ 4 - 16 + I = 0 + I \) and also that \( \left[ x + 2 + I \right] \left[ x ^ 3 - 2 x ^ 2 + 4x - 8 + I \right] = 0 + I  \)

<p>
                Consider the map \( \phi : \mathbb{ Z } _ 3 ^ \% \left[ x \right] \to \mathbb{ Z } _ 3 ^ \% \left( i \right)    \) defined by \( \phi \left( p \left( x \right)  \right) = p \left( i \right) \), note that the domain is correct because for any \( n \in \mathbb{ N } _ 0 \), \( i ^ n \in \left\{ 1, -1, i, -i \right\}  \) so therefore \( p \left( i \right) = c + di \) for some \( c, d \in \mathbb{ Z } _ 3 ^ \%  \). Moreover see that it is a homomorphism quite easily by verifying multiplication, addition and that clearly it maps \( 1 \) to \( 1 \).

<p>
                Additionally this map is surjective because given any \( a + bi \in \mathbb{ Z } _ 3 ^ \% \left( i \right)  \)   we see that the polynomial \( a + b x \) will map to it under \( \phi \), this means that \( \operatorname{ im } \left( \phi  \right) :=  \phi \left( \mathbb{ Z } _ 3 ^ \% \left[ x \right]   \right) = \mathbb{ Z } _ 3 ^ \% \left( i \right)    \), with that knowledge <a class="knowledge-link" href="/algebra/galois_theory/quotient_rings.html#theorem-crone-homomorphism-induces-an-isomorphism-to-its-image">therefore</a> we have that

            </p>
<p>
                We'll now prove that \( \operatorname{ ker } \left( \phi \right) = \left( x ^ 2 + 1 \right) _ \diamond \). Starting with \( \supseteq  \) recall that \( \left( x ^ 2 + 1 \right) _ \diamond  \) are all the multiples of \( x ^ 2 + 1 \), moreover \( \phi \left( x ^ 2 + 1 \right) = 1 + \left( i \right) ^ 2 = 0  \) therefore \( x ^ 2 + 1 \in \operatorname{ ker } \left( \phi  \right)  \), since any element of \( \left( x ^ 2 + 1  \right) _ \diamond  \) is a multiple of \( x ^ 2 + 1 \) then by taking an arbitrary element from it, it must be of the form \( m \left( x \right) \cdot \left( x ^ 2 + 1 \right)   \)  where \( m \left( x \right) \in \mathbb{ Z } _ 3 ^ \%  \left[ x \right]  \) but since \( \phi  \) is a homomorphism, then we know that \( \phi \left( m \left( x \right) \left( x ^ 2 + 1 \right)  \right) = \phi \left( m \left( x \right)  \right) \phi \left( x ^ 2 + 1 \right) = 0    \), thus \( \left( x ^ 2 + 1 \right) _ \diamond \subseteq \operatorname{ ker } \left( \phi  \right)  \).

<p>
                Now approaching the other inclusion we suppose we have some \( p \left( x \right) \in \operatorname{ ker } \left( \phi  \right)  \), clearly if \( p \left( x \right) = 0 \) tne \( \phi \left( phi \left( x \right)  \right) = 0  \) on the other hand if \( p \left( x \right)  \) is a constant other than zero, then also \( \phi \left( p \left( x \right)  \right) \neq 0  \) therefore we may assume that \( p \left( x \right)  \) is non-constant, in such a case <a class="knowledge-link" href="/algebra/galois_theory/prime_ideals_and_maximal_ideals.html#proposition-irreducible-either-has-gcd-1-or-divides-with-any-other-polynomial-non-constant">we know that</a> either \( \gcd \left( p \left( x \right) , x ^ 2 + 1 \right) = 1  \) or that \( \left( x ^ 2 + 1 \right) \mid p \left( x \right)   \).

                Therefore since it's degree is 2, then we can conclude that \( p \left( x \right)  \) is irreducible, which implies that \( I \) is maximal.
            </p>
<p>
                As we look to find the gcd, we just observe the following simple calculation
                \[
                \left( 3 x + 2  \right) 2 x = x ^ 2 + 4 x \qquad \text{ and } \qquad \left( 3 x + 2  \right) \left( - 1  \right)  = - 3 x - 2

                Therefore we have that
                \[
                x ^ 2 + x + 1 = \left( 3x + 2 \right) \left( 2 x - 1 \right) + 3
                \]
                So that the gcd is also one. This allows us to conclude that \( 2x - 1 + I \) is the multiplicative inverse of \( 3 x + 2 + I \) in \( \mathbb{ Z } _ 5  ^ \%  \left[ x \right] / I   \)

                    \psi \left( \left( a + 4 \mathbb{ Z }  \right) + \left( b + 4 \mathbb{ Z }  \right)   \right) = \psi \left( \left( a + b \right) + 4 \mathbb{ Z }  \right) = \left( a + b \right) + 2 \mathbb{ Z } = a + 2\mathbb{ Z } + b + 2 \mathbb{ Z } = \psi \left( a + 4 \mathbb{ Z }  \right) + \psi \left( b + 4 \mathbb{ Z }  \right) 
                \]
                So that \( \psi  \) respects addition, and also that
                \[
                    \psi \left( \left( a + 4 \mathbb{ Z }  \right) \cdot \left( b + 4 \mathbb{ Z }  \right)   \right) = \psi \left( a \cdot b + 4 \mathbb{ Z }  \right) = a \cdot b + 2 \mathbb{ Z } = \psi \left( a + 4 \mathbb{ Z }  \right) \cdot \psi \left( b + 4 \mathbb{ Z }  \right)
                \]
                so that \( \psi  \) respects multiplication, and then we note
                \[
                    \psi \left( 1 \right) =  \psi \left( 1 + 4 \mathbb{ Z }  \right) = 1 + 2 \mathbb{ Z } = 1
                \]
                Thus we conclude that \( \psi  \) is a crone homomorphism.

<div class="content">
            Given an irreducible polynomial \( p \left( x \right) \in F \left[ x \right]  \) we know that the field \( E := F \left[ x \right] / \left( p \left( x \right)  \right) _ \diamond  \) contains \( F \)  and a root \( \theta := x + I \)  of \( p \left( x \right)  \) . A natural question to ask is: does the field E contain all the roots of \( p(x) \) ? Here we will see that sometimes the answer is “yes” and sometimes “no”.
            <ul>
<li>
                    Let \( p \left( x \right) = x ^ 2 + x + 1 \in \mathbb{ Z } _ 2 ^ \% \left[ x \right]   \) and consider the field with 4 elements \( E := F \left[ x \right] / \left( p \left( x \right)  \right) _ \diamond = \left\{ a + b \theta : a, b \in \mathbb{ Z } _ 2 ^ \%   \right\}   \). We know \( \theta \)  is a root of \( p \left( x \right)  \) . Show that \( E \)  contains the other root of \( p \left( x \right)  \) as well.

<li>

Note that the map \( \phi : E \to \mathbb{ Q } \left( 2 ^ \frac{1}{3}  \right)  \) defined by 
                    \[
                        \phi \left( a + b \theta + c \theta ^ 2 \right) = a + b 2 ^ \frac{1}{3} + c \left( 2 ^ \frac{1}{3}  \right) ^ 2
                    \]
                    is an isomorphism of the two fields. Recall that \( \mathbb{ Q } \left( 2 ^ \frac{1}{3}  \right)  \)  does not contain the other two roots of \( p \left( x \right)  \) since they are non-real complex numbers while \( \mathbb{ Q } \left( 2 ^ \frac{1}{3}  \right) \subseteq \mathbb{ R }   \). Prove that \( E \) does not contain any other root of \( p \left( x \right)  \)  other than \( \theta  \) . Hint: use the isomorphism
                </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="proof">
<p>
                For the first part, we'll notice that if \( \theta   \) is a root then we know that \( \theta ^ 2 + \theta + 1 = 0 \), but on that same thought we also note
                \[
                    \left( \theta + 1 \right) ^ 2 + \left( \theta + 1 \right) + 1 = \theta ^ 2 + 2 \theta + 1 + \theta + 1 + 1 = \theta ^ 2 + \theta + 1 = 0
                \]
                So that \( E \) also contains the other root of \( x ^ 2 + x + 1  \)
            </p>
<p>
                For the second part we set \( s = 2 ^ \frac{1}{3}  \) for convience. Now note the following factorization 
                \[
                    p \left( x \right) = x ^ 3 - 2 = \left( x - s \right) \left( x ^ 3 + sx + s ^ 2 \right)
                \]
                Therefore if \( \mathbb{ Q } \left( s \right)  \) has some root of \( p \left( x \right)  \) other than \( s \), then it must be a root of \( x ^ 3 + sx + s ^ 2 \), but we can compute the roots of this polynomial via the quadratic equation, which yields
                \[
                    -\frac{s}{2} \pm  \sqrt{s ^ 2 - 4 s ^ 2}
                \]
                and therefore we see these roots are in \( \mathbb{ C } \setminus \mathbb{ R }  \), therefore there are no other real roots other than \( s \) in \( \mathbb{ Q } \left( s \right)  \).
            </p>
<p>
                Now recall that a quadratic polynomial over any field \( F \) has no roots in \( F \) iff it is irreducible in \( F \left[ x \right]  \), and that is preserved over isomorphisms of \( F \) with another field. Now observe that through \( \phi  \) we can verify that this bijection forms a homomorphism, and thus is an isomorphism, so that \( \mathbb{ Q } \left( s \right)  \) and \( E \) are isomorphic, and therefore \( E \) doesn't contain any other root of \( p \left( x \right)  \)

    	</div>
<div class="proof">
            Let's first observe that there is no element in \( \mathbb{ Q } \left( 2 \right)  \) that is a root of \( x ^ 2 - 3 \), to see why suppose we have some \( a + b \sqrt{2} \in \mathbb{ Q } \left( \sqrt{2} \right)  \), if it's a root, then we know 
            \[
                \left( a + b \sqrt{2} \right) ^ 2 = 3
            \]
            and the left hand side is \( \left( a + b \sqrt{2} \right) ^ 2 = a ^ 2 + 2 b ^ 2 + 2 a b \sqrt{2} \), since the product and sum of a non-zero rational with an irrational is irrational, then since \( 3 \) is not irrational, we conclude that \( a b = 0 \),
            <p>
                If \( a = 0 \), then we know that \( b ^ 2 = \frac{3}{2} \) which is not solvable in \( \mathbb{ Q }  \) , however given \( b = 0 \) then we have that \( 3 = a ^ 2 \) which is also not solvable in \( \mathbb{ Q }  \), so that there is no element in \( \mathbb{ Q } \left( 2 \right)  \) that is a root of \( \left( x ^ 2 - 3 \right)  \)
            </p>

                We show that they are not isomorphic by contradiction, so we suppose that they are isomorphic and see what happens, if they are isomorphic, then we have

            \]
            but then \( \phi  \left( \sqrt{3} \right)  \) is an element of \( \mathbb{ Q } \left( \sqrt{2} \right)  \) which is a root of \( x ^ 2 - 3 \) which is clearly impossible, so no such isomorphism exists.

<div class="proof">
<p>
                We a-priori know that \( \pi \) is trancedental. We also know that \( \mathbb{ Q } \left( \pi ^ 3 \right) = \left\{ \frac{f \left( \pi ^ 3 \right) }{ g \left( \pi ^ 3 \right)}   : f \left( x \right) , g \left( x \right) \in \mathbb{ Q } \left[ x \right], g \left( \pi ^ 3 \right) \neq 0  \right\}   \).
            </p>
<p>
                Assume for the sake of contradiction that \( \pi \in F \left( \pi ^ 3 \right)  \) with numerator and denominator of degree \( n, m \) respectively , therefore
                \[
                    \pi = \frac{a _ 0 + a _ 1 \pi ^ 3 + \ldots a _ n \pi ^ { 3n } }{b _ 0 + b _ 1 \pi ^ 3 + \ldots b _ m \pi ^ { 3m } }
                \]
                with \( a _ n, b _ m \neq 0 \), so that by re-arranging we can obtain this form
                \[
                    b_m \pi^{3m+1} + \ldots + b_1 \pi^4 + b_0 \pi -a_n \pi^{3n} + \ldots + a_1 \pi^3 + a_0 = 0

                this is a polynomial of degree either \( 3 n  \) or \( 3 m + 1 \), but in either case, it is a non-zero polynomial, because the coefficient on this term is non-zero as stated earlier.
            </p>
<p>
                But this would imply that \( \pi \) is a root of the polynomial obtained by syntactically replacing every \( \pi \) with \( x \) in the above expression and interpreting it as that as a polynomial, which would imply that \( \pi \) is algebraic, which it is not. Therefore \( \pi \notin \mathbb{ Q } \left( \pi ^ 3 \right)  \)

                A transcendental number is a real or complex number that is not algebraic, that is to say it is not a root of a non-zero polynomial of finite degree with rational coefficients. Suppose that \( \alpha \) is transcendental over \( \mathbb{ Q }  \).
                
<!--                It has been shown that \( \pi \) is a transcendental number.-->
</p>
<p>
                Consider the map \( f : \mathbb{ Q } \left[ x \right] \to \mathbb{ Q } \left( \alpha \right)     \) so that for any \( p \in \mathbb{ Q } \left[ x \right]  \) we have
                \[
                    f \left( p \right) = p \left( \alpha \right) 
                \]
            </p>
<p>
                Let \( p, q \in \mathbb{ Q } \left[ x \right]  \), then \( f \left(  p + q \right) = \left( p + q \right) \left( \alpha \right) = p \left( \alpha \right) + q \left( \alpha \right) = f \left( p \right) + f \left( q \right)     \) which follows from basic facts about finite summations. Additionally we have that \( f \left( p \cdot q \right) = \left( p \cdot q \right) \left( \alpha \right) = p \left( \alpha \right) \cdot q \left( \alpha \right)   = f \left( p \right) f \left( q \right)     \) which follows from the definition of polynomial multiplication (which holds when \( x \) holds a real number). Finally \( f \left( 1 \right) = 1  \) since there is no varaible to evaluate, so that \( f \) is a homomorphism.
            </p>
<p>
                Note that the kernel of \( f \) is empty, for if an element were to be in the kernel then \( \alpha \) would be a root of that polynomial, which is impossible because \( \alpha \) is transcendental. Therefore by the first isomorphism theorem we have an isomorphism between \( \mathbb{ Q } \left[ x \right] / \operatorname{ ker } \left( f \right) = \mathbb{ Q } \left[ x \right]    \) and \( \operatorname{ im } \left( f  \right) = \mathbb{ Q } \left( \alpha \right)  \). That is to say that \( \mathbb{ Q }  \left( \alpha \right)  \)'s elements are fully described by \( \mathbb{ Q } \left[ x \right]  \)  elements, which are polynomials with rational coefficients. We also know \( \mathbb{ Q } \left( \alpha \right) = \left\{ \frac{f \left( \alpha \right) }{ g \left( \alpha \right) }: f, g \in \mathbb{ Q } \left( x \right), g \left( \alpha \right) \neq 0  \right\}   \), which is another way of describing the elements of \( \mathbb{ Q } \left( \alpha \right)  \).

                Moving onto the next question, let's observe that \( F \left( \pi \right) / F  \) is a field extension, and that \( \pi \in F \left( \pi \right)  \), note that \( x ^ 3 - \pi ^ 3 \) is a monic polynomial in \( F \left[ x \right]  \) such that \( \pi \) is a root, therefore \( \pi \) is algebraic over \( F \).
            </p>
<p>
                We can also observe that \( x ^ 3 - \pi ^ 3 \) is irreducible in \( \mathbb{ Q } \left( \pi ^ 3 \right)  \) this follows from what we <a class="knowledge-link" href="/algebra/galois_theory/quotient_rings.html#lemma-pi-is-not-an-element-of-Q-adjoin-pi-to-the-three">showed earlier</a> and then we have that 
                \[
                    \mathbb{ Q } \left( \pi ^ 3 \right) \left[ x \right] / \left(  x ^ 3 - \pi ^ 3 \right) _ \diamond \cong \mathbb{ Q } \left( \pi ^ 3 \right) \left( \pi \right)
                \]
                As seen earlier \( \mathbb{ Q } \left( \pi ^ 3 \right) \left[ x \right] / \left(  x ^ 3 - \pi ^ 3 \right) _ \diamond \) can be viewed as a vector space over \( \mathbb{ Q }  \left( \pi ^ 3  \right)  \) with a basis given by \( \left( 1, x \boldsymbol{+} I, \left( x \boldsymbol{+} I \right) ^ 2 \right)  \). Now the isomorphism between these two structures is actually defined pointwise as  \( \Phi \left( x + \left( x ^ 3 - \pi ^ 3 \right) _ \diamond  \right) = \pi   \), in other words we obtain that a basis for \( F \left( \pi \right)  \) is \( \left( 1, \pi, \pi ^ 2 \right)  \) through this isomorphism.

            Let \( f \left( x \right) \in F \left[ x \right]  \)  and \( a \in F \). Show that \( f \left( x \right)  \)  and \( f \left( x + a \right)  \)  have the same splitting field over \( F \)  .

<div class="proof">
<p>
                Let \( E \) be the splitting field of \( f \) over \( E \), note that \( E \) is a field extension of \( F \). Since \( f \) splits here, then also \( E \) contains all the roots \( r _ 1, \ldots , r _ n \) of \( f \).
            </p>
<p>
                Observe that \( r _ 1 - a, \ldots , r _ n - a \) are roots of \( f \left( x + a \right)  \), and that they reside within \( E \) as well, this is seen because since \( E \) is a field extension of \( F \) then \( a \in E \) and therefore \( r _ i - a \in E \) as it's a field.
            </p>
<p>
                At this point we want to claim that \( E \) is a splitting field for \( f \left( x + a \right)  \), but to do that we need to show that there is no proper subfield in which \( f \left( x + a \right)  \) splits. For the sake of contradiction, if there was, then we'd have a problem because we could use this proper subfield as a splitting field for \( f \left( x \right)  \) by a similar argument, which contradicts the fact that \( E \) was a splitting field.

            Find the splitting field of \( f \left( x \right)  = x ^ 4 − x ^ 2 − 2 \)  over \( \mathbb{ Z } _ 3 ^ \%  \).

<div class="proof">
<p>
                We start by observing the following factorization:
            </p>
            \[
                x ^ 4 - x ^ 2 - 2 = \left( x ^ 2 - 2 \right) \left( x ^ 2 + 1 \right) = \left( x ^ 2 + 1 \right) ^ 2
            \]
            <p>
                By brute force, we can observe that there are no roots to the polynomial in \( \mathbb{ Z }  _ 3 ^ \%  \), therefore it is irreducible, so that we obtain the field extension \( E := \mathbb{ Z } _ 3 ^ \% \left[ x \right] / \left( x ^ 2 + 1 \right) _ \diamond   \) that contains a root \( a \), we can see that \( a \neq 0 \) and also that since it's a root we have that \( a ^ 2 + 1 = 0 \), but then also that \( \left( 2 a \right) ^ 2 + 1 =  4 a ^ 2 + 1 = a ^ 2 + 1 = 0 \) so then \( 2a \) is a different root, therefore \( E \) contains all roots of \( x ^ 2 + 1 \) so that it must split here, specifically we know \( \left( x + a \right) \left( x - a \right)  \) is the split.
            </p>
<p>
                Now we have to prove that there is no proper subfield of \( E \) such that \( x ^ 2 + 1 \) splits, this follows from the fact that it's a degree 2 extension and that 2 is prime in conjunction with the degree division formula. Thus we've shown that \( E \) is indeed the splitting field of \( f \) as needed.

            Let \( p \)  be a prime, determine the number of irreducible quadratic polynomials over \( \mathbb{ Z } _ p ^ \%  \). Hint: Compute it first for monic polynomials
    	</div>
<div class="proof">
<p>
                We first start by looking at monic polynomials, so they are of the form \( x ^ 2 + ax + b \) that of which there are \( p ^ 2 \) by iterating through all possible values for \( a, b \in \mathbb{ Z } _ p ^ \%  \).
            </p>
<p>
                Now given such a polynomial, we know that it is reducible if it can be factored into linear terms of the form \( \left( x + c \right) \left( x + d \right)  \) where \( c, d \in \mathbb{ Z } _ p ^ \%  \) each of which gives rise to \( x ^ 2 + \left( c + d \right) x + cd  \) which is uniquely associated with this factorization. With that said, there are \( \frac{p \left( p - 1 \right) }{2}  \) such factorizations, each of which yields a unique reducible polynomial. Thus we conclude that the number of irreducible monic polynomials is given by
                \[
                    p ^ 2 - \frac{p \left( p - 1 \right)}{2} = \frac{p \left( p - 1 \right) }{2}
                \]
            </p>
<p>
                Now if we want to know the number of irreducible quadratic polynomials over \( \mathbb{ Z } _ p ^ \%  \) which aren't necessarily monic, we can realize that that such a polynomial is of the following form
               \[
                   k \left( x ^ 2 + ax + b \right)
               \]
                where \(  k \in \mathbb{ Z } _ p ^ \% \setminus \left\{ 0 \right\}   \) and \( x ^ 2 + ax + b \) is irreducible in \( \mathbb{ Z } _ p ^ \%  \), that of which there are \( \frac{p \left( p - 1 \right) }{2}  \), thus for each such choice of \( k \), which there are \( p - 1 \) choices of we obtain a unique irreducible polynomial, and therefore there are
                \[
                    \frac{p \left( p -1 \right) ^ 2}{2}

                We'll use the cubic formula to determine the roots, let's start with \( x ^ 3 + 9 x - 1 \) because it's in the correct form.
            </p>
<p>
                Let's recall that the roots of a polynomial of the form \( x ^ 3 + qx + r \)  are given by the following
                \[
                    y + z \qquad \omega y + \omega ^ 2 z \qquad \omega ^ 2 y + \omega z

            Such that:
            <ul>
<li>
                    \( y = \left( \frac{1}{2} \left( -r + \sqrt{R} \right)  \right) ^ \frac{1}{3}   \)
                </li>
<li>
                    \( z = \frac{-q}{3y} \)
                </li>
<li>
                   \( R = r ^ 2 + \frac{4 q ^ 3}{27}  \)

                    \( \omega = e ^ \frac{2 \pi i}{3}  \)
                </li>
</ul>
<p>
                In our question \( q = 9 \) and \( r = -1 \) so let's start by computing \( R = \left(  -1 \right) ^ 2 + \frac{4 \left( 9 \right) ^ 3}{27} = 1 + 4 \cdot \left( \frac{9}{3}  \right) ^ 3 = 1 + 4 \cdot  27 = 109 \), let \( \alpha =  \left( \frac{1}{2} \left( 1 + \sqrt{109} \right) \right) ^ \frac{1}{3}\) therefore  \( y = \alpha  \) and thus \( z = \frac{-9}{3 \alpha} = \frac{-3}{\alpha}  \), thus our roots are given by
                \[
                    \alpha + \frac{-3}{\alpha }  \qquad \omega \alpha + \omega ^ 2 \frac{-3}{\alpha} \qquad \omega ^ 2 \alpha + \omega \frac{-3}{\alpha}
                \]
            </p>
<p>
                We now move our attention to \( f \left( x \right) = x ^ 3 + x ^ 2 - 1 \) which is not in the correct form to apply the cubic formula, although we do have <a class="knowledge-link" href="/algebra/galois_theory/quotient_rings.html#proposition-constructing-a-reduced-polynomial">a method</a> to deal with this, so we employ it.
            </p>
<p>
                In our case \( n = 3 \) and  \( a _ { n - 1 } = 1  \) so therefore we turn our attention to the polynomial \( f \left( x - \frac{1}{3}  \right)  \) 
                \[
                    f \left( x - \frac{1}{3}  \right) = \left( x - \frac{1}{3}  \right) 3 + \left( x - \frac{1}{3}  \right) ^ 2 - 1
                \]
            </p>
<p>
                Let's break down \( \left( x - \frac{1}{3} \right) ^ 2\) first:
                \[
                    \left( x - \frac{1}{3}  \right) \left( x - \frac{1}{3}  \right) = x ^ 2 - \frac{2}{3} x + \frac{1}{9}
                \]
                Now we can try \( \left( x - \frac{1}{3}  \right) ^ 3  \)
                \[
                    \begin{align}
                    \left( x - \frac{1}{3}  \right) ^ 3 &= \left( x - \frac{1}{3}  \right) \left( x - \frac{1}{3}  \right) ^ 2 \\
                &= \left( x - \frac{1}{3}  \right) \left( x ^ 2 - \frac{2}{3} x + \frac{1}{9} \right) \\
                &= \left( x ^ 3 - \frac{2}{3} x ^ 2 + \frac{x}{9}  \right) - \left( \frac{x ^ 2}{3} - \frac{2}{9} x + \frac{1}{27}  \right) \\
                &= x ^ 3 - \left( \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{3}   \right) x ^ 2 + \frac{3}{9} x - \frac{1}{27} \\
                &= x ^ 3 - x ^ 2 + \frac{x}{3}  - \frac{1}{27} 
                \end{align}
                \]
            </p>
<p>
                Now back to computing \( f \left( x - \frac{1}{3}  \right)  \) we have 
                \[
                    \begin{align}
                        f \left( x - \frac{1}{3}  \right) &= \left( x - \frac{1}{3}  \right) ^ 3 + \left( x - \frac{1}{3}  \right) ^ 2  - 1 \\
                &= \left( x ^ 3 - x ^ 2 + \frac{x}{3}  - \frac{1}{27}  \right) +  \left( x ^ 2 - \frac{2}{3} x + \frac{1}{9} \right) - 1 \\
                &= x ^ 3 - \frac{x}{3} + \frac{2}{27} - 1 \\
                &= x ^ 3 - \frac{x}{3} - \frac{25}{27}
                    \end{align}
                \]
                Now our equation has the correct form to be able to apply the cubic formula and so we can do that, suppose we obtain roots \( r _ 1, r _ 2, r _ 3 \), then the roots of \( f \left( x \right)  \) are given by \( r _ 1 - \frac{1}{3} , r _ 2 - \frac{1}{3} , r  _ 2 - \frac{1}{3}  \)

                Assume \( b \ge 2 \) is a natural number and \( p \left( x \right) = a _ k x ^ k + a _ { k - 1 } x ^ { k - 1 } + \ldots + a _ 1 x + a _ 0 \) is a polynomial such that \( 0 \lt a _ i \lt b - 1 \). If \( p \left( b \right)  \) is a prime number then \( p \left( x \right)  \) is irreducible in \( \mathbb{ Z } \left[ x \right]  \)
            </q>

                Applying that to our polynomial, \( x ^ 5 + x ^ 2 + 5 \) we observe that \(  5 \le b - 1 \) must be true so that \( b \ge 6 \), by plugging in we see that \( p \left( 6 \right) = 7853 \) which is a prime number, and therefore \( f \left( x \right)  \) is irreducible in \( \mathbb{ Z } \left[ x \right]  \) then by gauss it is irreducible in \( \mathbb{ Q } \left[ x \right]  \).

                Looking at the next question we recall that we've proven <a class="knowledge-link" href="/algebra/galois_theory/quotient_rings.html#proposition-irreducible-polynomial-creates-a-basis">this fact</a> after observing this proof we note that clearly by the division algorithm we have that every element in \( E \) must be a coset of a polynomial of degree at most four, as a direct consequence we also note that \( \left( 1, \theta ^ 1, \theta ^ 2, \theta ^ 3, \theta ^ 4 \right)  \) is a basis for \( E \) over \( \mathbb{ Q }  \)

                We divide \( x ^ 5 + 2 x ^ 2 + 5 \) by \( x - \theta \) to obtain \( q \left( x \right) = x ^ 4 + \theta x ^ 3 + \theta ^ 2 x ^ 2 + \left( \theta ^ 3 + 2 \right) x + \left( \theta ^ 4 + 2 \theta \right)    \)
