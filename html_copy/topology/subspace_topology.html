        Suppose that \( A \) is a subspace of \( X \) and \( B \) is a subspace of \( Y \), then the product topology on \( A \times B \) is the same as the topology \( A \times B \) has as a subspace of \( X \times Y \)
    </div>
    <div class="proof">
        <p>We will show that the two topologies are equal by showing that the basis that generate them are equal.</p>
        <p>Given the subspace \( A \) of \( X \) and \( B \) of \( Y \), then the product topology of \( A \times B \) has a basis of elements of the form \( \left ( A \cap U \right ) \times \left ( B \cap V \right ) \) where \( U , V \) are open in \( X , Y \) respectively.</p>
        <p>On the other hand ,an open set in \( X \times Y \) is of the form \( U \times V \) where \( U , V \) are open in \( X , Y \) respectively, thus a basis element for \( A \times B \) (as a subspace of \( X \times Y \))is a set of the form \( \left ( A \times B \right ) \cap \left ( U \times V \right ) \).</p>
        <p>Now to connect the two recall thqt \( \left ( A \cap U \right ) \times \left ( B \cap V \right ) = \left ( A \times B \right ) \cap \left ( U \times V \right ) \). So given a set, it is in the first basis if and only if it is in the second basis, meaning that the two bases are equal, and thus they generate the same topology.</p>

        Lines Intersected With Boxes

        If \( L \) is a straight line in the plane, describe the topology \( L \) inherits as a subspace of \( \mathbb{ R } _ \ell \times \mathbb{ R } \) and as a subspace of \( \mathbb{ R } _ \ell \times \mathbb{ R } _ \ell \)
    </div>}
    <div class="proof">
        Since we know that a basis for \( \mathbb{ R } _ \ell \times \mathbb{ R } \) are the sets of the form \( \left\{ [a, b) \times \left( c, d \right) \right\} \) thus we know that the basis for the subspace \( L \) are those basis elements intersected with \( L \), for the moment supposing that \( L \) is a line which is not vertical, then given a basis element \( B \) there are a few possibilities for the non-empty intersections:
        <ul>
            <li>\( L \) hits the left wall of \( B \), then the intersection is a half open interval</li>
            <li>\( L \) does not hit the left wall of \( B \)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>\( L \) hits the top and right, or bottom and right wall, the intersection results in an open interval</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>Finally note that it's impossible for the line to hit a corner of the square as the open intervals stop that from occuring, therefore the above enumerates all possibilties for a non-vertical line. In other words the basis for this subspace are the open intervals and the half open intervals, since we already know that the standard topology is a subspace of the lower limit topology, this simply generates the lower limit topology, formally we could show that there is a homeomorphism between them by finding the intersection with the x axis, then doing a rotation, but since we are describing, we will not go so far.</p>
        <p>When \( L \) is vertical, so that \( L = \left\{ \left( x_0, t \right) : t \in \mathbb{ R } \right\} \) it's not hard to see that the map \( f \left( \left( x_0, t \right) \right) = t \) and its inverse define a homeomorphism because open sets in \( L \) are all just intervals, and \( f \) pulls those back to the same interval in \( R \) (the other direction is similar) and so the vertical line subspace is the standard topology.</p>
        <p>Now if we consider \( \mathbb{ R } _ \ell \times \mathbb{ R } _ \ell \), and look at the line again, if \( L \) has positive slope then we get the lower limit topology as we get a basis as the half open intervals, if it is vertical or horizontal, then similarly to the above above, we get the factors, in this case the lower limit topology elsewise the slope is negative and it ends up being the discrete topology, that's because every single point set on \( L \) is open, to see why, given a single point \( \left( x, y \right) \) then it equals \( L \cap [x , x + 1) \times [y, y + 1) = \left\{ \left( x, y \right) \right\} \) thus we have all singletons, so the discrete topology.</p>
