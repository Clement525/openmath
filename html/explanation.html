			<h1>mathematical content</h1>

			<p>
				openmath is a static html site that uses vanilla js and css. Mathjax is used to render mathematical equations.
			</p>

			<p>
				let's look at the basic form of a definition, for example division
			</p>

			<code>
				<pre>
&ltdiv class="definition" id="definition-divides"&gt
	&ltdiv class="title"&gtdivides&lt/div&gt
	&ltdiv class="content"&gt
		an integer \( n \) is divisible by a non-zero integer \( m \) if there exists an integer \( k \) such that \( n = k \cdot m \). If this is all true we write \( m | n \).
	&lt/div&gt
&lt/div&gt
				</pre>
			</code>

			<p>
				breaking it down, we can see that there is a title, the content, mathematical equations written in <a href="http://asciimath.org/">asciimath</a> surrounded by backticks and the outer div is given a special id.
			</p>

			<p>
				Each of the classes used here are defined in <code>/styles/style.css</code> and gives it styling (similar to beamer)
			</p>

			<p>
				Now let's look at a more complicated example
			</p>

			<code>
				<pre>
&ltdiv id="proposition-1-divides-everything"&gt
	&ltdiv class="proposition"&gt
		&ltdiv class="title"&gt1 divides everything&lt/div&gt
		&ltdiv class="content"&gt
			Suppose that \( j \in \mathbb{Z} \), then \( 1 | j \)
		&lt/div&gt
	&lt/div&gt

	&ltdiv class="proof"&gt
		&ltdiv class="title"&gt&lt/div&gt
		&ltdiv class="content"&gt
			In the &ltspan class="knowledge-link" data-href="/number_theory/number_theory.html#definition-divides"&gtdefinition of divides&lt/span&gt take \( k = j \), then we can see that \( j = j \cdot 1 \) thus we can say that \( 1 | j \)
		&lt/div&gt
	&lt/div&gt
&lt/div&gt
				</pre>
			</code>

			<p>
				As you can see we've packaged both the statement and the proof into a div with it's own id. In the proof, we have something new: the knowledge link.
			</p>
			<p>
				A knowledge link is what allows for recursive learning, and is used when we are referencing a piece of information such as a definition, or proved statement, so that the reader knows how we deduce that the next statement is true via this knowledge.
			</p>

			<p>
				Notice that the form of the <code>data-href</code> is an absolute path and the id of the element delimited with a # symbol. This was chosen because of the way the <code>data-href</code> in the javascript code.
			</p>

			<p>
				Speaking of javascript, let's take a look at <code>/js/script.js</code> which contains all the main logic, specificially let's take a look at the function <code>setUpKnowledgeLink</code>. Feel free to open this code in your editor of choice.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this function the main steps are to use the <code>data-href</code> to fetch the relevant section of html from the respective webpage, and paste it after the knowledge link when it is clicked.
			</p>

			<p>
				From this point onward, you can explore the <code>preparePage</code> function which is main function call used on every page, besides the css for a page that is all the code that runs.
			</p>


			<h1>header</h1>

			<p>
				in <code>preparePage</code> the header is loaded in programatically using a fetch call, see <code>setUpAndAddHeader</code>
			</p>
