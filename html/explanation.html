			<h1>Introduction</h1>

			<p>
				The purpose of this page is to help users get more comfortable with how openmath works before, as an intermediary between using the site and working with the source code.
			</p>

			<p>
				openmath is a static html site that uses vanilla js and css, we use a few external libraries for graphics and formatting mathematical content.
			</p>

			<p>
				Some of the strong pull factors for openmath are that it's incredibly simple, it is a static site that contains mathematical content, while at the same time having the strength of a database by being able to refer to other content located in other files without being a dynamic site.
			</p>

			<p>
				We manage to do this by lazily using fetch requests in unison with <code>document.getElementById</code> calls, which indirectly induces a type of filesystem database.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example suppose that we have a knowledge link on <code>A.html</code> pointing to some knowledge located at <code>B.html#definition-somedef</code>, then we fetch the html from <code>B.html</code>, parse it into a document, then use <code>document.getElementById("definition-somedef")</code> on that document, and inject the resulting element back into <code>A.html</code> and then re-run MathJax on that element.
			</p>

			<p>
				We keep the cost of this operation low, by keeping our knowledge files small, which is also nice for the user as they're not overwhelmed with information
			</p>

			<h1>Details</h1>

			<p>
				let's look at the basic form of a definition, for example division
			</p>

			<code>
				<pre>
&ltdiv class="definition" id="definition-divides"&gt
	&ltdiv class="title"&gtdivides&lt/div&gt
	&ltdiv class="content"&gt
		an integer \( n \) is divisible by a non-zero integer \( m \) if there exists an integer \( k \) such that \( n = k \cdot m \). If this is all true we write \( m | n \).
	&lt/div&gt
&lt/div&gt
				</pre>
			</code>

			<p>
				Breaking it down, we can see that there is a title, the content, mathematical equations written in latex (and parsed by MathJax)  and the outer div is given a special id.
			</p>

			<p>
				Each of the classes used here are defined in <code>/styles/style.css</code> and gives it styling (similar to beamer)
			</p>

			<p>
				Now let's look at a more complicated example
			</p>

			<code>
				<pre>
&ltdiv class="proposition" id="proposition-1-divides-everything"&gt
	&ltdiv class="title"&gt1 divides everything&lt/div&gt
	&ltdiv class="content"&gt
		Suppose that \( j \in \mathbb{Z} \), then \( 1 | j \)
	&lt/div&gt

	&ltdiv class="proof"&gt
		In the &ltspan class="knowledge-link" data-href="/number_theory/number_theory.html#definition-divides"&gtdefinition of divides&lt/span&gt
		take \( k = j \), then we can see that \( j = j \cdot 1 \) thus we can say that \( 1 | j \)
&lt/div&gt
				</pre>
			</code>

			<p>
				As you can see we've packaged both the statement and the proof into a div with it's own id. In the proof, we have something new: the knowledge link.
			</p>
			<p>
				A knowledge link is what allows for recursive learning, and is used when we are referencing a piece of information such as a definition, or proved statement, so that the reader knows how we deduce that the next statement is true via this knowledge.
			</p>

			<p>
				Notice that the form of the <code>href</code> is an absolute path and the id of the element delimited with a # symbol. This is actually a regular URL, nothing fancy here.
			</p>

			<p>
				The most relevant entry point will be, to take a look at <code>/js/script.js</code> which contains all the main logic, specificially let's take a look at the function <code>setUpKnowledgeLink</code>. Feel free to open this code in your editor of choice.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this function the main steps are to use the <code>href</code> to fetch the relevant section of html from the respective webpage, and paste it after the knowledge link when it is clicked.
			</p>

			<p>
				From this point onward, you can explore the <code>preparePage</code> function which is main function call used on every page. Besides the css for a page that is all the code that runs.
			</p>


			<h1>Templates</h1>
			<p>
				in <code>preparePage</code> the header is loaded in programatically using a fetch call, see <code>setUpAndAddHeader</code>.
