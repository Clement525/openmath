           TODO: so long as the program halts, the proof is that there exists a function which does something, has some property, changes something returns something etc... proofs have state and as you read it there is knowledge which is known to be true, why we can use functions like max and min on a set of numbers, because they can be defined in finitely many steps. Humans also care about time complexity but not in the same way, we need to be able to read your proof in less than a human lifetime or else no one would ever understand your proof.
