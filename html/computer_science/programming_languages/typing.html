        How do we have dynamictype templates? We store the type as a pointer to the type so that every object has a fixed size. this allows us to polymorphism. Because given a genric type how will we be able to know the size of something at compile time?
    </p>
    <p>
        In java all fields that are typed generically are stored by reference. When we use void* we are losing type information and this is denoted by type erasure
    </p>
    <p>
        The approach that c++ takes is to "copy and paste" the abstrat data definition for every type varaible, as if the programmer had manually written distinct "box containing a Char" and "box containing a Doulbe" dat definitions. This is like a macro, this means that <code>Box[Char]</code> and <code>Box[Double]</code> will have different sizes, eg Box[Char] = 1 + 2 * 8 = 17 (1 char + 2 function pointers) and Box[Double]: 8 + 2 * 8 = 24, but note that things might be padded to better sizes.
    </p>

    <p>
        With the first approach you know that all of the boxes have the same size, whereas in the c++ approach is more efficient because we don't have one level of indirection with a pointer, everything is in the object, the downside being that two different objects have different sizes.
    </p>

    <p>
        When we do parametric polymorphism, we make a universal quantification saying "for any type a, Box a is a type". But perhaps we want to do more: "assert that it implements some interface".
    </p>

    <p>
        Typeclases, adhoc polymorphism, subclasses (inheritance). Suppose that \( \pi \left( t \right)  \) is a predicate that consumes a type and produces a boolean

    <div class="definition" id="definition-">
    	<div class="title">Qualified Type</div>
    	<div class="content">
    		We say that a polymorphic type \( Q \) if a particular t satisfies \( \pi \left( t \right)  \)
    	</div>
    </div>

    <p>
        For example, we can use qualified types to add constraints to the addition function
    </p>

    <pre>
        (+): forall t , pi(t) => t -> t -> t where pi(t) = (t == Integer || t == Double)

    </div>

    <p>
        One way of doing this is by doing method overloading with different arguments like this:
    </p>

    <pre>
        bar(int i, int j) {
            return i + j;
        }

        bar(double i, double j) {
            return i + j;
        }
    </pre>

    <div class="definition" id="definition-typeclass">
    	<div class="title">Typeclass</div>
    	<div class="content">
    		A typeclass is a family of types (the instances of the classes) with associated functions defined for each instance of the class.
    	</div>
    </div>

    <p>
        In haskell <code>(Show mybool)</code> asserts that mybool must be an instance of Show. Note that mybool is a type here, which is a new concept because in OOP instances meant objects of a type, whereas here instances of a typeclass are types.
    </p>

    <pre>
        -- typeclass declaration, (if a type a satisfies this json constraint then it has prodvided an impl of toJSON)
        class JSON a where  (A: a is a type variable, and defines JSON a which determins if a is a JSOn type)
            toJSON :: a -> String

        -- Bool (define an instance of a type class)
        instance JSON Bool where
            toJSON True = "true"  (a function of type boolean to string using pattern matching)
            toJSON False = "false"

        instance JSON a => JSON [a] where  (B)
            toJSON l = "[" ++ (concat ...

        ghci
        *Main :t toJSON
        toJSON :: JSON a => a -> String (if a has type JSON, then toJSON is a function from type a to String)


    </pre>

    <p>
        {-# OVERLAPPABLE #-} allows us to clobber another type class instance declaration.
    </p>

    <pre>
        instance JSON Char where
            toJSON = "world"

        toJSON "hello" (notice that now either A or B could be used)
    </pre>

    <p>
        In general Haskell will try to pick the more precise one, which is A because String is literally [Char] whereas the other is a generic [a] which could work for any type.
    </p>

    <p>
        We induce a typeclass hierarchy because when we have a qualified type, we're literally just specifying a subset of the elements of a given type, that's what induces the hierarchy.
    </p>

    <h2>Subtyping</h2>

    <pre>
        int i = 42;
        float f = i;
    </pre>

    <p>
        The above is fine in c++, it does implicit conversion by simply turning 42 to 42.0
    </p>

    <p>
        In OOP we can give the child class instead of a parent class in general.

    <p>
        \lt;: is similar to the subset relation, Dog \lt;: Animal.
    </p>

    <p>
        the LSP states that if phi(t) is a property that is provoable about objects t of type T, then phi(s) should be true for objects of type S where where S \lt;: T. Note that this would be trivial for subset relation, therefore this is more general, this means that S, T need not even have the same elements. Anything provable from
