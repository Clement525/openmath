<h1>Racket</h1>
<h2>Define</h2>
<p>The main command here is <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html">define</a>, the two main usages are to bind a value to the result of an expression, and to bind an id to a procedure.</p>
<p>To bind an id to the value of an expression do</p>
<pre>
        (define x 3)
    </pre>
<p>To bind an id to a procedure you can do</p>
<pre>
        (define (my-func arg1 arg2) (+ arg1 arg2))
    </pre>
<p>Note that this is equivalent to:</p>
<pre>
        (define my-func (λ (arg1 arg2) (+ arg1 arg2))
    </pre>
<h2>Local Name Bindings</h2>
<p>The Let expression allows us to make local name bindings, but the evaluation order of the bindings are done in some undefined order, meaning that they cannot depend on eachother.</p>

        Let in Racket

        What is the result of the following code:
        <pre>
                (define a 100)
                (define b 100)
                (define c 100)
                (let ([a 5] [b (+ a a)] [c (+ a b)]) (list a b c) )
            </pre>
    </div>
    <div class="proof">
        <p>Since the bindings of a let expression cannot depend on eachother, then previously computed values are not used until we are inside the body, thus we have the following</p>
        <p>Suppose that c gets bound to (+ a b) first, thus c' becomes 200, suppose a is bound next thus a' becomes 5, then suppose b is bound to (+ a a), since we don't use previously computed values, we still use a = 100, to get that b' is 200. Now we evaluate the body with these ticked variables to obtain '(5 200 200).</p>
        <p>Note that no matter what order they are evaluated you always will get the same answer.</p>

        Let Error

        Why does the following code work?
        <pre>
            (define sq-cube
                (lambda (x)
                    (let ([sqr (* x x)] [cube (* x sqr)]) (list sqr cube))
                )
            )
            </pre>
    </div>
    <div class="proof">
        <p>It won't work because there is no guarentee in which order the identifiers are bound, and thus if the second is bound first, <code>sqr</code> would be undefined.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>We can fix the above problem by nesting let statements or by using the let* expression which was defined exactly for having sequential let statements.</p>
<p>Also note that local name bindings do not update values, so if we had the following code</p>
<pre>
        (define a 10)
        (let ([a 5]) (+ a 100))
    </pre>
<p>Then the value of a is still 10. In general pure functions will never update values, which implies that every time a given function takes in a specfic set of values it will always return the same result and there are no side effects.</p>
<p>If no values ever change, then how do we actually do anything meaningful? Recursion.</p>
<h2>Symbols</h2>
<p>Symbols can be thought of like enums.</p>
<h2>Macros</h2>
<pre>
        (define-syntax list-of ; this is the initial name of macro
            (syntax-rules (for in) ; this are reserved keywords, match them literally
                (
                    (list-of result-element-expression for element-name in a-list) ; match this
                    (map (λ (element-name) result-element-expression) a-list) ; map it to this
                )
            )
        )
    </pre>
<p>Then <code>(list-of e for x in ls)</code> will get replaced with <code>(map (λ (x) e) ls)</code></p>
<p>Note that you can have recursive macros</p>
