                Assume \(G\) has a cycle \(C = (c_0, c_1, \dots, c_k)\). Consider the iteration when \(\mathtt{slow1}\)
                and \(\mathtt{fast}\) are both in \(C\) for the first time. Without a loss of generality, assume
                \(\mathtt{slow1} = c_0\) and \(\mathtt{fast} = c_i\), where \(i \in [0, k]\). Since
                \(C\) is a cycle of length \(k + 1\) and \(\mathtt{fast}\) traverses \(C\) at twice the speed of
                \(\mathtt{slow1}\), \(\mathtt{slow1} = \mathtt{fast}\) when \(t \equiv i + 2t
                \pmod{k+1}\), where \(t\) is the \(t\)-th iteration after \(\mathtt{slow1}\)
                and \(\mathtt{fast}\) are both in \(C\) for the first time.
                <br>
                Rearranging shows \(t \equiv -i \pmod{k+1}\). Therefore, \(\mathtt{slow1} = \mathtt{fast}\) for the
                first time when \(t = k + 1 - i\).

                The second while loop terminates and nums[slow1] is the meet point.
            </div>
            <div class="proof">


                \(G\) has a cycle \(C = (c_0, c_1, \dots, c_k)\). Let \(x\) be the distance from \(g_0\) to \(c_0\). Let
                \(y\) be the distance from \(c_0\) to \(c_i\), where \(c_i\) is the vertex where \(\mathtt{slow1} =
                \mathtt{slow2}\) after the first while loop. Let
                \(z\) be the distance from \(c_i\) back to \(c_0\).
                <br />
                <br />
                From the previous lemma, we know that the first while loop terminates before \(\mathtt{slow1}\)
                completes a cycle around \(C\), so \(\mathtt{slow1}\) travels \(x + y\) vertices by the end of that
                loop. We also know that \(\mathtt{fast}\) travels 2
                vertices for every vertex travelled by \(\mathtt{slow1}\), so it travels \(2(x + y)\) vertices by the
                end of the first while loop. Alternatively, we can express this number as \(x\) plus \(n\) complete
                cycles around \(C\) (which has a length of \(y + z\)) plus \(y\). Therefore, we have the following.
                <br />
                <br />
                \(\begin{align*}
                2(x + y) &= x + n(y + z) + y \\
                2x + 2y &= x + (n + 1)y + nz \\
                x &= (n - 1)y + nz \\
                x &= (n - 1)(y + z) + z
                \end{align*}\)
                <br />
                <br />
                Therefore, travelling \(x\) is equivalent to travelling \(n - 1\) complete cycles plus \(z\). So \(x\)
                iterations into the second while loop, \(\mathtt{slow2} = c_0\) by definition of \(x\), given
                \(\mathtt{slow2}\) is initialized to \(g_0\). Additionally,
                \(\mathtt{slow1} = c_0\) by definition of \(z\), since \(\mathtt{slow1}\) completes \(n - 1\) complete
                cycles around \(C\) plus \(z\).
                <br />
                <br />
                Therefore, \(\mathtt{slow1} = \mathtt{slow2}\) so the loop terminates and both \(\mathtt{slow1}\) and
                \(\mathtt{slow2}\) are at \(c_0\).

            <div class="proof">
                From the definition of the index array graph, consider it's movement sequence \( \textbf{ g } :=

                so
                \( X \) would be infinite, which is a contradiction, thus there is some duplicated element in the

                <p>
                    By definition of the meet point, it is encountered twice in the movement sequence \( \textbf{ g
                    } :=
                    \left( g _ 0, g _ 1, g _ 2, \ldots \right) \) on it's first encounter, we have some index \( i
                    \)
                    such that \( g _ i = m \) by the definition of the movement sequence this means that \( A \left[
                    g _
                    { i - 1 } \right] = m \) so that \( g _ { i - 1 } \) is the index of \( m \) in \( A \)
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the second encounter of \( m \) in the movement sequence we have some \( j \) where \( \left(
                    j
                    \gt i \right) \) such that \( g _ j = m \) so also that \( A \left[ g _ { j - 1 } \right] = m
                    \).
                    Now note that with respect to the movement sequence, we have the following subsequence \( g _ {
                    i -
                    1 }, m, \ldots , g _ { j - 1 }, m \), if \( g _ { i - 1 } = g _ { j - 1 } \) then \( m \) cannot
                    be
                    the meet point, because \( \left( g _ 0, \ldots g _ { j - 1 } \right) \) is a sequence with a
                    repeated element and so the meet point would be some \( g _ p \) where \( p \in \left[ 0, \ldots
                    , j
                    - 1 \right] \) it cannot be \( g _ i = m \) because the element \( g _ j = m \) is excluded, and
                    so
                    the meet point would have to be some \( g _ p \neq m \) which is a contradiction becase \( m \)
                    is
                    the meet point, therefore we must have that \( g _ { i - 1 } \neq g _ { j - 1 } \).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since each \( g _ k \) for any \( k \in \mathbb{ N } _ 0 \) is a valid index to \( A \) then we
                    have
                    that \( A \left[ g _ { i - 1 } \right] = A \left[ g _ { j - 1 } \right] = m \). Since \( A \)
                    contains exactly one duplicated element, then we must conclude that \( d = m \).
