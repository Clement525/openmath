                From the definition of the index array graph, consider it's movement sequence \( \textbf{ g } := \left( g _ 0, g _ 1, g _ 2, \ldots  \right)  \) and it's set define as \( X := \left\{ g _ i : i \in \mathbb{ N } _ 0 \right\}  \), by definition of \( A \) the movement sequence contains at most \( n \) unique numbers and so we see that \( \lvert X \rvert \le n \), and thus it is finite, this means that there is some duplicated element in the movement sequence, suppose there is not, then each element is unique, and so \( X \) would be infinite, which is a contradiction, thus there is some duplicated element in the movement sequence, and so a meet point exists.

                Since we know that all inputs arrays have a meet point then it's movement sequence is of the form \( g _ 0, \ldots g _ i, g _ { i + 1 } \ldots g _ { i + k },  g _ i, g _ { i + 1 }, \ldots g _ { i + k }, \ldots   \), where \( g _ i  \) is the meet point, and there are \( k \) other elements encountered before we get to the meet point. It must continue forever because after \( g _ i \) is encountered for the second element, then the next element is defined as \( A \left[ g _ i \right]  \) which is the same as the definition of \( g _ { i + 1 }  \) and so on until \( g _ i \) is reached again, therefore it continues cycling forever.

                The first while loop terminates and \(\mathtt{slow1} = \mathtt{fast}\).

                    Let \( \mathtt{slow1}_t \) be the value of \( \mathtt{slow1} \) at the end of the \( k \)-th iteration of the while loop. Observe that \( g _ k = \mathtt{slow1}_t \), this holds true for \( k = 0 \) as well where we have \( g _ 0 = 0 = \mathtt{slow1}_0 \), note that the equality holds true as each iteration of the while loop directly pertains the recursive definition of \( g _ { i + 1 } \), moreover note that \( \mathtt{fast}_k = g _ { 2k }  \) which can be verified in a similar manner. Note that this means that \( \mathtt{fast} \)'s movement sequence is a subsequence of \( \mathtt{slow1} \)'s denote this subsequence \( \textbf{ s } := \left( s _ 0, s _ 1, s _ 2, \ldots  \right)  \) where \( s _ i = g _ { 2i }  \) then we know that \( \mathtt{fast} _ k = s _ k\).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let \( G \) be the index array graph of \( A \), we know that it has a cycle that it gets stuck in forever by our previous corollary, and suppose that the elements of the cycle are given by \(C = (c_0, c_1, \dots, c_k) \), where \( c _ 0 \) is the meet point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consider the smallest index \( m \) where \( g _ m  \) and \( s _ m \) are both in \(C\) for the first time. Since the start of the cycle is the meet point, then we know that \( g _ m = c _ 0 \) whereas \( s _ m = c _ i  \) where \(i \in [0, k]\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since \(C\) is a cycle of length \(k + 1\) and \(\mathtt{fast}\) traverses \(C\) at twice the speed of \(\mathtt{slow1}\), (which is to say that \( g _ { m + l } = c _ { \left( 0 + l \right) ~\%~ { k + 1 }  }  \) and \( s _ { m + l } = c _ { \left( 0 + 2l \right) ~\%~ { k + 1 }   }   \)). Then we know that the value \( t \) for which \( \textbf{ g } \) and \( \textbf{ s } \)

                 \(\mathtt{slow1} = \mathtt{fast}\) when \(t \equiv i + 2t \pmod{k+1}\), where \(t\) is the \(t\)-th iteration after \(\mathtt{slow1}\) and \(\mathtt{fast}\) are both in \(C\) for the first time.


                Assume \(G\) has a cycle
                Rearranging shows \(t \equiv -i \pmod{k+1}\). Therefore, \(\mathtt{slow1} = \mathtt{fast}\) for the
                first time when \(t = k + 1 - i\).

                    By definition of the meet point, it is encountered twice in the movement sequence \( \textbf{ g } := \left( g _ 0, g _ 1, g _ 2, \ldots  \right)  \) on it's first encounter, we have some index \( i \) such that \( g _ i = m \) by the definition of the movement sequence this means that \( A \left[ g _ { i - 1 }  \right] = m  \) so that \( g _ { i - 1 }  \) is the index of \( m \) in \( A \)

                    On the second encounter of \( m \) in the movement sequence we have some \( j \)  where \( \left( j \gt i \right) \)  such that \( g _ j = m \) so also that \( A \left[ g _ { j - 1 }  \right] = m  \). Now note that with respect to the movement sequence, we have the following subsequence \( g _ { i - 1 }, m, \ldots , g _ { j - 1 }, m  \), if \( g _ { i - 1 } = g _ { j - 1 }   \) then \( m \) cannot be the meet point, because \( \left( g _ 0, \ldots g _ { j - 1 }  \right)  \) is a sequence with a repeated element and so the meet point would be some \( g _ p \) where \( p \in \left[ 0, \ldots , j - 1 \right] \) it cannot be \( g _ i = m \) because the element \( g _ j = m \) is excluded, and so the meet point would have to be some \( g _ p \neq m \) which is a contradiction becase \( m  \) is the meet point, therefore we must have that \( g _ { i - 1 } \neq  g _ { j - 1 }   \).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since each \( g _ k \) for any \( k \in \mathbb{ N } _ 0 \)  is a valid index to \( A \) then we have that \( A \left[ g _ { i - 1 }  \right] = A \left[ g _ { j - 1 }  \right] = m \). Since \( A \) contains exactly one duplicated element, then we must conclude that \( d = m \).
