            Consider the following problem: Given an array of integers <code>nums</code> containing \( n + 1  \) integers where each integer is in the range \( \left[ 1, \ldots , n \right]  \) inclusive, where there is only one repeated number in <code>nums</code> return this repeated number.

            We propose that the following algorithm does this:

It must continue forever because after \( g _ i \) is encountered for the second element, then the next element is defined as \( A \left[ g _ i \right]  \) which is the same as the definition of \( g _ { i + 1 }  \) and so on until \( g _ i \) is reached again, therefore it continues cycling forever.

Observe that \( g _ k = \mathtt{slow1}_t \), this holds true for \( k = 0 \) as well where we have \( g _ 0 = 0 = \mathtt{slow1}_0 \), note that the equality holds true as each iteration of the while loop directly pertains the recursive definition of \( g _ { i + 1 } \), moreover note that \( \mathtt{fast}_k = g _ { 2k }  \) which can be verified in a similar manner. Note that this means that \( \mathtt{fast} \)'s movement sequence is a subsequence of \( \mathtt{slow1} \)'s denote this subsequence \( \textbf{ s } := \left( s _ 0, s _ 1, s _ 2, \ldots  \right)  \) where \( s _ i = g _ { 2i }  \) then we know that \( \mathtt{fast} _ k = s _ k\).

                    Consider the smallest index \( x \) where \( g _ x  \) and \( s _ x \) are both in \(C\) for the first time. Since the start of the cycle is the meet value, then we know that \( g _ x = c _ 0 \) whereas \( s _ x = c _ i  \) where \(i \in \mathbb{ N } _ 0  \)

                    Since \(C\) is a cycle of length \(k + 1\) and \(\mathtt{fast}\) traverses \(C\) at twice the speed of \(\mathtt{slow1}\), (which is to say that \( g _ { x + y } = c _ { \left( 0 + y \right) ~\%~ { k + 1 }  }  \) and \( s _ { x + y } = c _ { \left( y + 2y \right) ~\%~ { k + 1 }   }   \)) in tandem with the fact that all elements in the cycle are distinct and thus we know that \( c _ a = c _ b \) if and only if \(  a ~\%~ \left( k + 1 \right) = b ~\%~ \left( k + 1  \right)   \), we conclude that \( g _ { x + y } = s _ { x + y }   \) when \( y \equiv i + 2y \pmod{k+1} \),  where \(y\) is the \(y\)-th iteration after \(\mathtt{slow1}\) and \(\mathtt{fast}\) are both in \(C\) for the first time.

                     Rearranging shows \(y \equiv -i \pmod{k+1}\), if \( i = 0 \), then this is satisfied by \(  y = 0 \) which means that when both \( \mathtt{slow1} = c _ 0 = \mathtt{fast}  \) when they enter the cycle for the first time. On the other hand if \( i \gt  0 \) then \( y = k + 1 - i \) satisfies the equation. Note that there are infinitely other non-negative solutions, but these two solutions are the smallest ones, thus the while loop will encounter these first before any larger ones and terminate, thus \( y \in \left\{ 0, \ldots , k \right\}  \).

                The second while loop terminates and nums[slow1] is the meet value.
            </div>
            <div class="proof">


                \(G\) has a cycle \(C = (c_0, c_1, \dots, c_k)\). Let \(x\) be the distance from \(g_0\) to \(c_0\). Let
                \(y\) be the distance from \(c_0\) to \(c_i\), where \(c_i\) is the vertex where \(\mathtt{slow1} =
                \mathtt{slow2}\) after the first while loop. Let
                \(z\) be the distance from \(c_i\) back to \(c_0\).
                <br />
                <br />
                From the previous lemma, we know that the first while loop terminates before \(\mathtt{slow1}\)
                completes a cycle around \(C\), so \(\mathtt{slow1}\) travels \(x + y\) vertices by the end of that
                loop. We also know that \(\mathtt{fast}\) travels 2
                vertices for every vertex travelled by \(\mathtt{slow1}\), so it travels \(2(x + y)\) vertices by the
                end of the first while loop. Alternatively, we can express this number as \(x\) plus \(n\) complete
                cycles around \(C\) (which has a length of \(y + z\)) plus \(y\). Therefore, we have the following.
                <br />
                <br />
                \(\begin{align*}
                2(x + y) &= x + n(y + z) + y \\
                2x + 2y &= x + (n + 1)y + nz \\
                x &= (n - 1)y + nz \\
                x &= (n - 1)(y + z) + z
                \end{align*}\)
                <br />
                <br />
                Therefore, travelling \(x\) is equivalent to travelling \(n - 1\) complete cycles plus \(z\). So \(x\)
                iterations into the second while loop, \(\mathtt{slow2} = c_0\) by definition of \(x\), given
                \(\mathtt{slow2}\) is initialized to \(g_0\). Additionally,
                \(\mathtt{slow1} = c_0\) by definition of \(z\), since \(\mathtt{slow1}\) completes \(n - 1\) complete
                cycles around \(C\) plus \(z\).
                <br />
                <br />
                Therefore, \(\mathtt{slow1} = \mathtt{slow2}\) so the loop terminates and both \(\mathtt{slow1}\) and
                \(\mathtt{slow2}\) are at \(c_0\).

Now note that with respect to the movement sequence, we have the following subsequence \( g _ { i - 1 }, m, \ldots , g _ { j - 1 }, m \), if \( g _ { i - 1 } = g _ { j - 1 } \) then we get contradiction because by the definition of the meet value \( g _ j = m \) it's assumed that \( j \) was the smallest value such that \( \left( g _ 0, \ldots ,g _ m \right)  \) has a duplicated value, but under the assumption that \( g _ { i - 1 } = g _ { j - 1 }  \) then \( j - 1 \) would be a smaller value such that \( \left( g _ 0, \ldots , g _ { j - 1 }  \right)  \) has a repeated value, therefore we must have that \( g _ { i - 1 } \neq g _ { j - 1 } \).
