        A Sorted Tuple Missing an Element Has a Change Point
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Suppose that \( a \in \left[ 1 \ldots n \right] ^ { n - 1 } \) and that \( \operatorname{ set } \left( a \right) = \left[ 1 \ldots n \right] \setminus \left\{ x \right\} \) for some \( x \in \left[ 1 \ldots n \right] \), and that \( a \) is sorted in ascending order. Then there exists some \( i \in \left[ 1 \ldots n \right] \) such that \( \forall j \in \left[ n \right] \) if \( j \le i \) then \( a \left[ j \right] = j \) and if \( i \lt j \) then \( a \left[ j \right] = j + 1 \)

<p>The above proposition says in plain english that if we have a sorted tuple that is missing one element, then there is some index \( i \) such that the index equals the value at that position up to or equal to index \( i \) and after that the value is the index plus one. Note that the above talks about numbers \( \left[ 1 \ldots n \right] \), in our problem we use numbers from the set \( \left\{ 0 , \ldots , m \right\} \), the situation is analogous.</p>
<p>The idea is that we need to find the "change point", it can be seen that if \( a \left[ j \right] = j \) then the change point can only be to the right, otherwise it must be to the left, this in conjuction with the fact that \( a \) is sorted allows us to employ binary search to find the specific element. We've proven in the past that this algorithm is correct, therefore it will correctly identify the change point.</p>
<h1>Pseudocode</h1>
<pre>
        def find_missing_rec(arr, start_idx, end_idx):

            if start_idx == end_idx:
                return arr[start_idx] - 1

            mid_idx = (start_idx + end_idx) / 2

            if arr(mid_idx) == mid_idx:
                find_missing_rec(arr, mid_point + 1, end_idx)
            else:
                find_missing_rec(arr, start_idx, mid_idx)

        def find_missing(arr):
            sort(arr)
            find_missing_rec(arr, 0, len(arr) - 1)
    </pre>
<h1>Runtime</h1>
<p>Note that <code>find_missing_rec</code> operates the same way that binary search does, note that binary seach has \( \mathcal{ O } \left( \log _ 2 n \right) \) runtime. But we also must sort the array before passing it to <code>find_missing_rec</code> this makes the runtime \( \mathcal{ O } \left( n \log _ 2 n \right) \)</p>
<h1>Motivation and Corretness</h1>
<div class="proposition" id="proposition-equal-number-of-ones-and-zeros">
    <div class="title">
        Equal Number of Ones and Zeros
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Suppose that \( X := \operatorname{ base\_repr } \left( [0 \ldots 2 ^ l - 1], 2 \right) \subseteq \mathbb{ B } \) where we are taking the image of the <a class="knowledge-link" href="/number_theory/number_bases.html#definition-base-representation">base representation</a> function. Then we claim that for any \( i \in [1 \ldots l] \) we have \[ \lvert \left\{ x \in X: x[i] = 0 \right\} \rvert = \lvert \left\{ x \in X: x[i] = 1 \right\} \rvert = 2 ^ { l - 1 } \]
    </div>
    <div class="proof"></div>
</div>
<p>With the above claim in hand, it's not hard to see that since \( B \) is missing one element then it's size is \( 2 ^ l - 1 \), thus by fixing an index \( i \) and then partitioning by those that have \( 0 \) at position \( i \) and those that have a \( 1 \) (let us denote the former by \( \textbf{0} _ i \) and the latter with \( \textbf{1} _ i \) , then there will be an imbalance. By that we mean that one partition have \( \pm 1 \) the size of the other.</p>
<p>This imbalance is key, suppose \( \textbf{ 0 } _ i \) has one less element than \( \textbf{1} _ i \), then we observe that the missing element must have a \( 0 \) at position \( i \) otherwise it would have increased the size of \( \textbf{0} _ i \) which would have removed the imbalance (which is a contradiction).</p>
<p>Therefore by repeating this process for each index \( i \) we can obtain what the missing value's bit is at index \( i \). Note that whenever we finish finding the value at index \( i \), we no longer have to use index \( i \) ever again. Given \( \textbf{0} _ i \), if we construct the set \( \textbf{0} _ i ^ \prime \) by simply extracting the \( 0 \) at position \( i \) from each binary number, and then doing the same but extracting the \( 1 \)'s in \( \textbf{1} _ i \) to obtain \( \textbf{1} _ i ^ \prime \), then \( \textbf{0} _ i ^ \prime = \textbf{1} _ i ^ \prime \), this is true if we consider generating binary numbers by taking the previous binary numbers and extending them by appending a \( 1 \) or a \( 0 \) at a specific position to produce to produce binary numbers of one greater length.</p>
<p>The upshot from the above is that we can simply select one of \( \textbf{0} _ i \) , \( \textbf{1} _ i \) when we continue our search. With this reduction we can see that the size of our search cuts down by half each time.</p>
<p>We could simply conclude that by the master theorem that our runtime is in \( \mathcal{ O } \left( m \right) \), but it more visually pleasing to see a direct calculation. Note that in the first iteration we must go through each binary number in the list, which there are \( m \) of, thus we take \( m \) steps, now we throw out half of our space, and do the same, thus this takes \( \frac{m}{2} \) iterations, we do this exactly \( \log _ 2 m = l \) times, which yields the finite summation of \[ \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ l \frac{m}{2 ^ i} = m \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ l \frac{1}{2 ^ i} \]</p>
<p>Note that the summation being multiplied by \( m \) is bounded by \( 2 \) \[ \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ l \frac{1}{2 ^ i} = \frac{ \frac{1}{2 ^ { l + 1 }} - 1}{ \frac{1}{2} - 1} = \frac{1 - \frac{1}{2 ^ { l + 1 } } }{\frac{1}{2} } = 2 - \frac{1}{2 ^ { l } } \le 2 \]</p>
<p>Therefore we can conlcude that our runtime is \( \mathcal{ O } \left( 2m \right) = \mathcal{ O } \left( m \right) \)</p>

<p>The returned number has same string length, but is not equal to any binary number in the input list therefore it is the missing one.</p>
