        Suppose we have an undirected graph \( G = (V, E) \) where  \( |V| = n \) and \( |E| = m \). Assume \( G \) is connected and we want to delete some edges such that the resulting graph is disconnected. Give a \( \mathcal{O} (m \cdot n^2) \)-time algorithm that returns the minimum number of edges to delete to make the graph disconnected. Briefly explain why your algorithm works.
    </p>

    <p>
        We'll first note recall the <a class="knowledge-link" href="/computer_science/algorithms/graphs/network_flow/ford_fulkerson.html#theorem-max-flow-min-cut">following theorem</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Now suppose we take the above graph \( G \) and assume it has at least 2 vertices, let \( s, t \in V \) and then augment \( G \) to \( G ^ \prime \)  as follows.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>For every edge \( \left\{ u, v \right\}  \) which is not connected to either \( s \) or \( t \), create two directed edges of the form \( \left( u, v \right)  \) and \( \left( v, u \right)  \)</li>
        <li>
            For all outgoing edges from \( s \) of the form \( \left\{ s, x \right\}  \) create the directed edge \( \left( s, x \right)  \)
        </li>
        <li>
            For all incoming edges to \( t \) of the form \( \left\{ y, t \right\}  \) create the directed edge \( \left( y, t \right)  \)
        </li>
        <li>
            Give every directed edge unit capacity
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Thus if we run Ford-Fulkerson on the above, then it will return the maximum flow from \( s \) to \( t \), by the Max-Flow Min-Cut theorem, we know that this value is equal to the minimum capacity over all s-t cuts, and we know that the capacity of a cut is the sum of the capacity of edges in the cut set.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since every capacity is one, then the minimum capacity over all s-t cuts, is actually referring to the number of edges involved in the s-t cut, also note that any s-t cut disconnects the graph because there is no longer a path between \( s \) and \( t \), therefore the value that Ford-Fulkerson returns is actually the minimum number of edges to remove to disconnect \( s \) and \( t \) in the original graph \( G \).
    </p>

    <p>
        The above isn't the solution to the given problem though. When we compute the min cut between \( s \) and \( t \) we're computing the cut with the smallest weight for every cut that actually separates \( s \) and \( t \). Now suppose that the minimum number of edges to remove to disconnect the graph is \( n \) and specifically the cut involves the edges \( e _ 1, \ldots , e _ n \), in this case, it's possible that this cut actually leaves \( s \) and \( t \) connected. Therefore the solution we've been discussing might not actually give us the minimum number of edges to remove in the entire graph \( G \).
    </p>

    <p>
        We can remedy this by iterating over all possible pairs \( a, b \) using one as source node and one as a terminal node. We won't have to care about order so this will take exactly \( \frac{n \left( n - 1 \right)}{2}  \) iterations using a running minimum.
    </p>

    <p>
        The reason why this running minimum over pairs idea works is that given the original graph, and it's minimal number of edges required to disconnect it, we know that it specficially will disconnect a pair of nodes \( a, b \) and thus is equal to the minimum number of edges required to disconnect specifically \( a, b \). Thus when our running minimum reaches \( a, b \) it will compute the smallest value and then that is what will be returned.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that for integer capacities, then the complexity of running ford fulkerson is given by \( \mathcal{ O } \left( f \lvert E \rvert  \right)  \), in our case \( f = 1 \) and \( m = \lvert E \rvert  \) and therefore due to our previous paragraph we can conclude the runtime is given by \( \mathcal{ O } \left( n ^ 2 m \right)  \)

<!--        Now recall the <a class="knowledge-link" href="/graph_theory/graphs.html#proposition-a-disconected-graph-is-the-union-of-many-disjoint-connected-ubgraphs">following theorem from graph theory</a>.-->
<!--    </p>-->

<!--    <p>-->
<!--        Therefore we have some disjoint subgraphs \( S _ 1, S _ 2, \ldots , S _ k \) which are connected. Also note that the number of edges require to disconntect any of these subgraphs is greater or equal to the number of edges required to disconnect the original, otherwise the minimal number of edges would have resided in some \( S _ k \) and then it would have been split. So suppose that we select two subgraphs \( S _ i, S _ j \), and we take \( x, y \in S _ i, S _ j \) respectively, then we note that the minimal number of edges required to disconnect \( x \) and \( y \) in \( G \) is the same as the number of edges required to disconnect \( G \), this follows from the fact that it takes more edges to disconnect \( x \) from \( y \) by trying disconnect them in \( S _ i \) or \( S _ j  \) and than by crossing the cut.-->
<!--    </p>-->

<!--    <p>-->
<!--        Now since these subgraphs form a partition of \( V \), then \( s \) resides in some subgraph \( S _ m \), now we just have to iterate every \( n \in V \setminus \left\{ s \right\}  \) and use our algorithm to compute the minimum number of edges required to disconnect \( s \) and \( x \). And take the min over all of those answers. The reason this returns the minimum value is that eventually as \( n  \) varies, it must land in some other subgraph \( S _ c \) where \( c \neq m \) and therefore when we compute the minimum number of edges between \( s \) and \( n \) we actually get the minimum number of edges to disconnect the entire graph.-->
