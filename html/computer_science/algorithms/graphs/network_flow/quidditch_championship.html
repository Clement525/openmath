    <h1>Quidditch Championship</h1>

    <p>
        A muggle wants to know the outcome of Quidditch championship. You are a wizard to help him. A house wins the championship if it wins more matches than the other houses at the end of championship. If a house cannot finish first under any outcome of the remaining matches, then we call the house <b>eliminated</b>. For some houses, you do not need to wait for all matches to be played to determine if these houses are eliminated or not.
    </p>

    \[
    \begin{array}{||c|c|c|c|c|c|c||}
    \hline
    \text{House} & \text{Wins} & \text{Remaining} & \text{vs.~Gryffindor} & \text{vs.~Hufflepuff} & \text{vs.~Ravenclaw} & \text{vs.~Slytherin} \\ \hline \hline
    \text{Gryffindor} & 23 & 8 & - & 1 & 6 & 1\\ \hline
    \text{Hufflepuff} & 19 & 4 & 1 & - & 0 & 3 \\ \hline
    \text{Ravenclaw} & 18 & 7 & 6 & 0 & - & 1\\ \hline
    \text{Slytherin} & 16 & 5 & 1 & 3 & 1 & -\\ \hline
    \end{array}

    <ul>
        <li>In the table above, which house(s) have been eliminated? Briefly explain why.</li>
        <li>Let's generalize this problem. Suppose there are $n$ houses competing for the Quidditch cup. Let \( H = \{1,...,n\} \)  denote the set of houses in the championship. For each \( i \in H \), let \( w_i \) be house \( i \)'s number of wins so far; let \( r_i \) be the number of remaining matches to compete by house \( i \); let \( r_{ij} \) be number of remaining matches for house \( i \) to compete against house \( j \) (apparently  \( r_{ij} = r_{ji} \) ). \\</li>
        <li>
            Given any house $h \in H$, design a network flow to answer if \( h \) is eliminated. To make the question simpler, assume there is no trivial case: for every house \( i \in H \), there does not exist a house \( j \)  such that \( w_i + r_i < w_j \) . You are free to use edges with infinite capacity. After constructing your flow, you should make a claim: "if a flow of value ..., then house \( h \)  is eliminated", and then prove your claim.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your construction in (b) can decide whether a single house $h$ is eliminated or not. If we want to determine all the eliminated houses, how many network flow instances do we need to construct? Briefly explain why.
        </li>
    </ul>
