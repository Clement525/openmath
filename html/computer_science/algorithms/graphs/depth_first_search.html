        DFS is not Complete
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Suppose that \( s, g \) are two connected vertices in a potentially infinite graph with a maximum branching factor of \( b \in \mathbb{ N } _ 0 \), then it's possible that DFS may not find a path connecting \( s \) and \( g \).
    </div>
    <div class="proof">
        Suppose we have the embedded graph of \( \mathbb{ N } _ 0 \), but we also have a child node of \( 0 \) which is distinct from \( 1 \) called \( g \), then if DFS expands \( 1 \) first, then it will never expand \( g \) because it will go down the infinite chain of natural numbers.
