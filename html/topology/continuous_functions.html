                        Now suppose that \( f \left( U \right) \subseteq Y \) is an open set, since \( f: X \rightarrow Y  \) is a continuous function, then we know that \( f ^ { -1 } \left( f \left( U \right)  \right)  \) is open in \( X \), since \( f \) is <a class="knowledge-link" href="/fundamentals/functions.html#definition-invertible">invertible</a>, <a class="knowledge-link" href="/fundamentals/functions.html#theorem-bijective-iff-invertible">then it is</a> a bijection,  <a class="knowledge-link" href="/fundamentals/functions.html#definition-bijective-function">so it is</a> injective and <a class="knowledge-link" href="/fundamentals/functions.html#corollary-inverse-image-of-the-image-cancels-if-injective">therefore</a> \( f ^ { - 1 } \left( f \left( U \right) \right) =  U   \) which shows that \( U \) is open, as needed.

                        Since we've proven both directions this completes the proof.
