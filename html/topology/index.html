                        We'll start by showing that `pi_1` is continuous, so let `U` be open in `X` and now we can note that `pi_1^{-1}(U) = U xx Y` since the second component never matters in the computation of `pi_1(x, y) = x`

                            We'd like to show that `f` is an <a href="#imbedding">imbedding</a>, that is that both `f^'` and `(f^{'})^{-1}` are both continuous functions where `f'` is `f` with it's range restricted to `f(X)`.

                        <p>
                            Starting with `f^'` and acutally looking at the original `f` we can see that it can be defined as `f(x) = (id(x), c(x))` with the identity and constant function respectively. Looking at the <a href="#rules-for-constructing-continuous-functions">rules for contructing continuous functions</a>, we can see that `id: X -> X` is simply an inclusion function from `X` into itself, and that `c: Y -> y_0` is a constant funciton, and thus are both continuous, also since <a href="#product-functions-are-continuous">product functions are continuous</a> we know that `f` is continuous, using rule 4, we can see that `f'` is also continuous.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Looking at `(f^')^{-1}: X xx {y_0} -> X`, we can see that this function simply drops the second component and thus `(f^')^{-1} = pi_1` and since <a href="projection-functions-are-continuous">projection functions are continuous</a>, we've shown that the inverse function is continuous.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            With all that said, we now know that `f'` is a homeomorphism, which by definition means that `f` is an imbedding, which is what we needed to show.

                        Since we know that `d^'` is a metric, then now we can check to see if it induces the usual standard topology of `RR^n`. To show this we'll show that the toplogy induced is equal to the standard toplogy of `RR^n`
