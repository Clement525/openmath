						We'll show that `O/` and `Y` are elements of `T_(nn Y)`, this can be seen as since `O/ in T`, then `Y nn O/ = O/ in T_(nn Y)` and also since `Y sube X`, <span class="knowledge-link" data-href="/fundamentals/sets.html#proposition-a-set-intersected-with-a-superset-is-itself">then</span> `Y nn X = Y` so `Y in T _ (nn Y)`

						Now we want to prove that `T _(nn Y)` is closed under arbitrary unions, which we know <span class="knowledge-link" data-href="/fundamentals/sets.html#proposition-intersection-factors-from-intersection">because</span> `bigcup_(alpha in I) (U_alpha nn Y) = (bigcup_(alpha in I) U_alpha) nn Y`.

						Suppose that `A` is a subspace of `X` and `B` is a subspace of `Y`, then the product topology on `A xx B` is the same as the topology `A xx B` has as a subspace of `X xx Y`
					</div>
					<div class="proof">
						<p>
							We will show that the two topologies are equal by showing that the basis that generate them are equal.
						</p>
						<p>
							Given the subspace `A` of `X` and `B` of `Y`, then the product topology of `A xx B` has a basis of elements of the form `(A nn U) xx (B nn V)` where `U, V` are open in `X, Y` respectively.
						</p>
						<p>
							On the other hand ,an open set in `X xx Y` is of the form `U xx V` where `U, V` are open in `X, Y` respectively, thus a basis element for `A xx B` (as a subspace of `X xx Y`)is a set of the form `(A xx B) nn (U xx V)`.
						</p>
						<p>
							Now to connect the two recall thqt `(A nn U) xx (B nn V) = (A xx B) nn (U xx V)`. So given a set, it is in the first basis if and only if it is in the second basis, meaning that the two bases are equal, and thus they generate the same topology.
