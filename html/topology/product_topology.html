					<p>
						Let `(x, y) in X xx Y`, then the basis element `B = X xx Y` works since `X,Y` are open in themselves.
					</p>
					<p>
						Suppose that `x in B_1 nn B_2` where `B_1 = U_1 xx V_1` and `B_2 = U_2 xx V_2`, then `B_1 nn B_2 = (U_1 xx V_1) nn (U_2 xx V_2)` but since <span class="knowledge-link" data-href="/fundamentals/sets.html#proposition-intersection-and-cartesian-product-commute">intersection and cartesian product commute</span>, then `B_1 nn B_2 = (U_1 nn U_2) xx (V_1 nn V_2)`, but since `U_1, U_2, V_1, V_2` are open in `X` and `Y` respectively, then so is their finite intersection so therefore `B_1 nn B_2` is already a basis element so we can take `B_3 = B_1 nn B_2` in the definition of a basis.

Then the collection `cc D = {B xx C : B in cc B text( and ) C in cc C}` then `cc D` <span class="knowledge-link" data-href="/topology/topological_spaces.html#definition-basis-for-a-topology">is a basis for the topology</span> of `X xx Y`

					<p>
						To show it's a basis we will use the <span class="knowledge-link" data-href="/topology/topological_spaces.html#theorem-basis-criterion">basis criterion</span>. So let `W` be an open set of `X xx Y`, and let `(x, y) in W`, since the product topology is generated by the basis `{U xx V: X in cc T_X text( and ) Y in cc T_Y}`, then we know that by the definition of a topology generated by a basis that there is an element `U xx V` such that `(x, y) in U xx V sube W`.

					<p>
						Since we assumed that `cc B` and `cc C` were <span class="knowledge-link" data-href="/topology/topological_spaces.html#definition-basis-for-a-topology">bases for</span> `X` and `Y` respectively then, we know that there is some element `B in cc B` such that `x in B sube U` and there is some `C in cc C` such that `y in C sube V`, thus we have found an element `B xx C in cc D` such that `(x, y) in B xx C sube U xx V = W` which proves that `cc D` is a basis and that it generates the toplogy of `X xx Y`
