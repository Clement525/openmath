					Suppose that \( X \) is a topological space, then the following conditions hold:
					<ul>
						<li>\( \emptyset \) and \( X \) are closed</li>
						<li>arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed</li>
						<li>finite unions of closed sets are closed</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="proof">
					<p>
						The complement of \( \emptyset , X \) in \( X \) are \( X , \emptyset \) respectively, which are both open in \( X \), making the original sets closed
					</p>
					<p>
						Suppose that \( \left \lbrace A_{\alpha} \right \rbrace_{\alpha \in I} \) is a collection of closed sets, then we know that \( X \backslash \bigcap_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha} = \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} \left ( X \backslash A_{\alpha} \right ) \), and since each \( A_{\beta} \) is closed then \( X \backslash A_{\beta} \) is open, making \( \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} \left ( X \backslash A_{\alpha} \right ) \) an arbitrary union of open sets, and is thus open, making \( X \backslash \bigcap_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha} \) open
					</p>
					<p>
						Now suppose that \( I \) is finite, and we'll show that \( X \backslash \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha} \) is open, we know this set is equal to \( \bigcap_{\alpha \in I} \left ( X \backslash A_{\alpha} \right ) \), and as a finite intersection of open sets, we know it is open as well showing the original set is open

					Let \( Y \) be a <a class="knowledge-link" href="/topology/subspace_topology.html#definition-subspace-topology">subspace</a> of \( X \), then a set \( A \) is closed in \( Y \) if and only if it equals the intersection of a closed set of \( X \) with \( Y \)
				</div>
				<div class="proof">
					<p>
						Let's start by assuming that we have a set \( A = C \cap Y \) where \( C \) is closed in \( X \), therefore \( X \backslash C \) is open in \( X \), therefore \( Y \cap \left ( X \backslash C \right ) \) <a class="knowledge-link" href="/topology/subspace_topology.html#definition-subspace-topology">is open</a> in \( Y \)

						Note that \( Y \cap \left ( X \backslash C \right ) \) <a class="knowledge-link" href="/fundamentals/sets/set_difference.html#proposition-intersection-distributes-through-intersection">\( = \)</a> \( \left ( X \cap Y \right ) \backslash C \) <a class="knowledge-link" href="/fundamentals/sets/set_difference.html#proposition-redundant-intersection-in-difference">\( = \)</a>  \( \left ( X \cap Y \right ) \backslash \left ( C \cap Y \right ) \) <a class="knowledge-link" href="/fundamentals/sets/union_and_intersection.html#proposition-a-set-intersected-with-a-superset-is-itself">\( = \)</a> \( Y \backslash A \) (where the last step is justified since we know \( Y \subseteq X \) ), this shows that \( Y \setminus A \) is open, meaning that \( A \) is closed in \( Y \)
					</p>
					<p>
						Now let's assume that \( A \) is closed in \( Y \), therefore \( A \subseteq Y \) and \( Y \backslash A \) is open in \( Y \), meaning that there is some set \( U \) open in \( X \) such that \( Y \backslash A = Y \cap U \) 
					</p>
					<p>
						Let's note that \( Y \setminus \left ( Y \setminus A \right ) \) <a class="knowledge-link" href="/fundamentals/sets/set_difference.html#proposition-triple-difference-equality">\( = \)</a> \( \left ( Y \cap A \right ) \cup \left ( Y \setminus Y \right ) = A \cup \emptyset = A\) so that

					\begin{align*}

						&= Y \setminus U \\ 
						&= \left ( X \cap Y \right ) \setminus U \\

						Since \( X \setminus U \) is closed in \( X \) this shows that \( A \) equals the intersection of a closed set with \( Y \) as needed.

				<div class="proof">
					<p>
						Set /( B /) equal to thee closure of /( A /) in /( Y /), since /( \bar{A} /) is closeed in /( Y /), then we know that /( \bar{A} \cap Y /) is closed in /( Y /), since /( B /) equals the intersection of all closed subsets of /( Y /) containing /( A /), and /( \bar{A} \cap Y /) is closed and contains /( A /) and thus /( B \subseteq /left( \\bar{A} \cap Y  /right) /)
