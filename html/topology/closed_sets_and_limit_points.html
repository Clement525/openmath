				<div class="content">
					Suppose that \( X \) is a topological space, the the following conditions hold:
					<ul>
						<li>\( \emptyset \) and \( X \) are closed</li>
						<li>arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed</li>
						<li>finite unions of closed sets are closedj</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="proof">
					<p>
						The complement of \( \emptyset , X \) in \( X \) are \( X , \emptyset \) respectively, which are both open in \( X \), making the original sets closed
					</p>
					<p>
						Suppose that \( \left \lbrace A_{\alpha} \right \rbrace_{\alpha \in I} \) is a collection of closed sets, then we know that \( X \backslash \bigcap_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha} = \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} \left ( X \backslash A_{\alpha} \right ) \), and since each \( A_{\beta} \) is closed then \( X \backslash A_{\beta} \) is open, making \( \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} \left ( X \backslash A_{\alpha} \right ) \) an arbitrary union of open sets, and is thus open, making \( X \backslash \bigcap_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha} \) open
					</p>
					<p>
						Now suppose that \( I \) is finite, and we'll show that \( X \backslash \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha} \) is open, we know this set is equal to \( \bigcap_{\alpha \in I} \left ( X \backslash A_{\alpha} \right ) \), and as a finite intersection of open sets, we know it is open as well showing the original set is open

				<div class="content">
					Let \( Y \) be a subspace of \( X \), then a set \( A \) is closed in \( Y \) if and only if it equals the intersection of a closed set of \( X \) with \( Y \)
				</div>
				<div class="proof">
					<p>
						Let's start by assuming that we have a set \( A = C \cap Y \) where \( C \) is closed in \( X \), therefore \( X \backslash C \) is open in \( X \), therefore \( \left ( X \backslash C \right ) \cap Y \) is open in \( Y \), since \( Y \subseteq X \), then \( \left ( X \backslash C \right ) \cap Y = \left ( X \cap Y \right ) \backslash \left ( C \cap Y \right ) = Y \backslash A \) showing that \( A \) is closed as needed.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now let's assume that \( A \) is closed in \( Y \), therefore \( Y \backslash A \) is open in \( Y \), meaning that there is some set \( U \) open in \( X \) such that \( Y \backslash A = Y \cap U \) therefore \( A = Y \cap \left ( X \backslash U \right ) \)
