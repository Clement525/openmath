					A subset `A` of a topological space `X` is said to be closed if `X \\ A` is open

				<div class="title">closed topology</div>
				<div class="content">
					Suppose that `X` is a topological space, the the following conditions hold:
					<ul>
						<li>`O/` and `X` are closed</li>
						<li>arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed</li>
						<li>finite unions of closed sets are closedj</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="proof">
					<p>
						The complement of `O/, X` in `X` are `X, O/` respectively, which are both open in `X`, making the original sets closed
					</p>
					<p>
						Suppose that `{A_alpha}_(alpha in I)` is a collection of closed sets, then we know that `X \\ bigcap_(alpha in I) A_alpha = bigcup_(alpha in I) (X \\ A_alpha)`, and since each `A_beta` is closed then `X \\ A_beta` is open, making `bigcup_(alpha in I) (X \\ A_alpha)` an arbitrary union of open sets, and is thus open, making `X \\ bigcap_(alpha in I) A_alpha` open
					</p>
					<p>
						Now suppose that `I` is finite, and we'll show that `X \\ bigcup_(alpha in I) A_alpha` is open, we know this set is equal to `bigcap_(alpha in I) (X \\ A _alpha)`, and as a finite intersection of open sets, we know it is open as well showing the original set is open

				<div class="title">closed in a subspace if and only iff it's intersection</div>
				<div class="content">
					Let `Y` be a subspace of `X`, then a set `A` is closed in `Y` if and only if it equals the intersection of a closed set of `X` with `Y`
				</div>
				<div class="proof">
					<p>
						Let's start by assuming that we have a set `A = C nn Y` where `C` is closed in `X`, therefore `X \\ C` is open in `X`, therefore `(X \\ C) nn Y` is open in `Y`, since `Y sube X`, then `(X \\ C) nn Y = (X nn Y) \\ (C nn Y) = Y \\ A` showing that `A` is closed as needed.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now let's assume that `A` is closed in `Y`, therefore `Y \\ A` is open in `Y`, meaning that there is some set `U` open in `X` such that `Y \\ A = Y nn U` therefore `A = Y nn (X \\ U)`
