                We'll consider \( G _ 0 = \left\{ e \right\}, G _ 1 = \left\{ e, \left( 1 2 3 \right), \left( 1 3 2 \right)   \right\}, G _ 2 = S _ 3   \). Recall that from group theory that if \( H  \) is a subgroup of \( G \) and that the index of \( H \) in \( G \) is 2, then \( H \) is a normal subgroup of \( G \), therefore in our context we can observe that \( G _ 1 \) is a normal subgroup of \( S _ 3 \) as it has index 2.

            <p>
                It's noted that trivially \( \left\{ e \right\}  \) is a normal subgroup of \( G _ 1 \). We'll now move to showing that \( G _ 0  / G _ 1 \) and \( G _ 1 / G _ 2 \) are abelian, for the first we just have to realize that \( G _ 1 \) is abelian itself because \( \left( 1 2 3 \right) \left( 3 2 1 \right) = \left( 3 2 1 \right) \left( 1 2 3 \right) = e \) and the rest of the comparisons are trivial, so also \( G _ 1 / G _ 0 \) is abelian. For \( S _ 3 / G _ 1 \), we can actually find that this is isomorphic to \( D _ 6 \) which we already know is abelian, therefore by definition we've shown that \( S _ 3 \) is solvable

            \( S _ n \) for \( n \ge 5 \) is not solvable

    	<div class="proof">
    	    Suppose for the sake of contradiction that \( S _ n \) 	is solvable, therefore there is a chain of subgroups of the form
            \[
    	    \left\{ e \right\} \leqslant G _ 1 \ldots G _ { n - 1 } \leqslant G _ n = S _ n
    	    \]
            wherein consecutive quotients are abelian, if we consider \( G _ n / G _ { n - 1 }  \), then if \( G _ n \) contains all the three cycles, then by what we proved proviously so does \( G _ { n - 1 }  \). Then if \( G _ { n - 1 }  \) contains all the three cycles so does \( G _ { n - 2 }  \) continuing on, we'll eventually arrive at a contradiction, therefore \( S _ n \) is not solvable.
