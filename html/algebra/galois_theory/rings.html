        Since \( \mathbb{ Z } _ 4 \) forms a ring then we can then notice the following:

        \begin{align}
        \left( [ 2 ] x + [ 1 ]  \right) ^ 2 &= [ 2 ] [ 2 ] x ^ 2 + [ 2 ] [ 1 ] x + [ 1 ] [ 2 ] x + [ 1 ] [ 1 ] \\

        &= [ 1 ]
        \end{align}

        Where we're noticing that the degree of the product has decreased, this is occuring because in \( \mathbb{ Z } _ 4 \) there are non-zero elements which have a product of \( 0 \).

    a direct sum of infinitely many nonzero rings has no unity

    I'm implicitly using the trivial fact that in any ring R with 1:   R = {0}  iff  1 = 0

    (in fact, 0*x = x*0 = 0   in all rings, even those lacking 1)

    (since  1*x = x  for all x,  and  0*x = 0  for all x,  in any ring with 1)

    Did you know that in any ring with 1, the axiom that addition is commutative is redundant with the rest of the axioms? That is, you can prove it, assuming only the other axioms.
