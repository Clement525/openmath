<p>Some examples of dielectrics are glass, plastic, rubber, paper, air and mica. The reason why we make the distinction is that insulators can be used to stop of the flow of electricity, but for storage of electric charge a dielectric is more useful. We also note that any highly conductive material cannot store charge (TODO: why)</p>
