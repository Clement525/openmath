        A resistor is an electrical component which relates current through it to voltage across it by the ohm's law equation: \(V = I * R\), where V is voltage measured in Volts, I is the current measured in Amperes, and R is it's resistance measured in Ohms.

        Capacitance is a unit used to quantify the ability of a capacitor to create a potential difference (measured in Volts) when a charge (measured in Coulombs) is stored across its surfaces. The formula for capacitance is \(C = \frac{Q}{V}\) where Q is electric charge in Coulombs, and V is the voltage across the surfaces of the capacitor

        Ohm's Law for Capacitors
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Ohm's Law, the law relating voltage linearly to current with the resistance constant \(V=IR\), can be adapted to relate voltage to current across a capacitor by taking the derivative of the equation for capacitance, \(C=\frac{Q}{V}\) to obtain an equation in terms of current as the rate of charge: \(I=C\frac{dV}{dt}\)
    </div>
    <div class="proof">
        \(VC=Q\), Take the time derivative of both sides of the equation, \(\frac{dV}{dt}C=\frac{dQ}{dt}\), convert \(\frac{dQ}{dt}\) to I for current, as current is defined as the charge flowing through per second
