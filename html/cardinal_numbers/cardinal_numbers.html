            <div class="proof">
                Let \( \{A_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} \) be a countable collection of countable sets. Denote \( A = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \). For each set \( A_n \), define an injection \( f_n: A_n \to \mathbb{N} \).
		
		Now define a function \( f: A \to \mathbb{N} \) as follows: for each element \( x \in A \), let \( i \) be the first index such that \( x \in A_i \). Define
		\[
		f(x) = 2^i \cdot 3^{f_i(x)}
		\]
		This ensures that \( f \) is an injection from \( A \) to \( \mathbb{N} \), as the use of distinct powers of 2 for each set guarantees that no two elements from different \( A_n \)'s are mapped to the same value in \( \mathbb{N} \), this follows from the uniqueness of the prime factorization.
		
		If \( A \) is finite, then it is trivially countable because finite sets are a special case of countable sets. If \( A \) is infinite, then the image of \( f \), \( \text{im}(f) \), is an infinite subset of \( \mathbb{N} \), and any infinite subset of \( \mathbb{N} \) is countable (since it has a bijection to \( \mathbb{N} \)).
		
		Therefore, \( A \) is bijective to \( \text{im}(f) \), and thus \( A \) is countable.
