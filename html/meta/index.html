        In mathematics we care about a few main things, firstly in mathematics, we start with axioms and then we come up with ideas, we use those ideas to come up with more ideas and continue this process.
    </p>

    <p>
        As we produce ideas that depend on many previous ideas, we have to use abstraction to be able to work efficiently, this is analagous to high level programming or operating a car, where we don't have to think about how the machine fundamentally works all the way through. (such as calling min on a collection of numbers, or turning the key to start the car)
    </p>

    <p>
        The point of that abstraction is that it allows us to work efficiently at a certain complexity level. If we had to think about how the whole shifting mechanism in a car works to be able to shift the car no one would be driving, we simply abstract what it does to the point where we can say this gear will allow me to travel up the hill easier, or go faster and then simply do it. For the high level programming example, we don't need to understand how to write assembly to make doom, but we should know that eventually it will become assembly.

        In mathematics one way to formalize things is through set theory, where ever
