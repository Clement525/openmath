        Suppose that \( f \in C \left[ 0, 1 \right] \) such that \( \int _ 0 ^ 1 f \left( x \right) x ^ n dx = 0 \) for every \( n \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \) then \( f = 0 \)

    <div class="proof">
        <p>By wat, we obtain a sequence of poly's \( \left( p _ k \right) \) that converge uniformly o \( f \).</p>
        <p>We know that for any \( k \) we see that \( p _ k \left( x \right) = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ {l _ k} c _ i x ^ i \) and therefore</p>\[ \int _ 0 ^ 1 f \left( x \right) p _ k \left( x \right) dx = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { l _ k } c _ i \int _ 0 ^ 1 f \left( x \right) x ^ n = 0 \]
        <p>Since products maintain uniform convergence, we also know that \( f \left( x \right) p _ n \left( x \right) \stackrel{\operatorname{ unif } }{\to } f \left( x \right) ^ 2 \). And define \( H _ n : \left[ 0, 1 \right] \to \mathbb{ R } \) as \[ H _ n \left( x \right) := \int _ 0 ^ x f \left( t \right) p _ n \left( t \right) dt \] <a class="knowledge-link" href="/analysis/single_variable/uniform_convergence_and_integration.html#theorem-integral-convergence">therefore</a> \( H _ n \stackrel{\operatorname{ unif } }{\to } H \) where \[ H \left( x \right) = \int _ c ^ x f ^ 2 \left( x \right) dx \] specifically when \( x = 1 \) we have that \[ \int _ 0 ^ 1 f \left( x \right) p _ n \left( x \right) dx \left( = 0 \right) \stackrel{\operatorname{ unif } }{\to } \int _ 0 ^ 1 f ^ 2 \left( x \right) dx \] thus \( \int _ 0 ^ 1 f ^ 2 \left( x \right) dx = 0 \) so that \( f = 0 \) as needed.</p>

        Continuous Extension on Compact Subset

        Let \( N \in \mathbb{ R } \) and let \( K \subseteq \left[ -N, N \right] \) be compact, then show that every continuous function \( f \) on \( X \) may be extended to a continuous function \( g \) on \( \left[ -N, N \right] \) such that \( \lVert f \rVert _ \infty = \lVert g \rVert _ \infty \), conclude that every continuous function on \( X \) is the uniform limit of polynomials.
    </div>
    <div class="proof">
        <p>We construct the new function \( g \) as follows, given \( p \in X \) then we define \( g \left( p \right) = f \left( p \right) \), otherwise \( p \notin X \), note that since \( X \) is compact it's closed so that \( X ^ C \) is open, since \( p \in X ^ C \) then we know that there exists some \( \epsilon \in \mathbb{ R } ^ + \) such that \( B \left( x, \epsilon \right) \subseteq X ^ C \)</p>
        <p>Now define \( L = \left\{ x \in X: x \lt p \right\} \) and \( R = \left\{ x \in X: x \gt p \right\} \). If both \( L = R = \emptyset \) then \( X = \left\{ p \right\} \) and so since we assumed \( p \notin X \) that would be a contradiction, so instead one of these must be non-empty, assume that \( L \neq \emptyset \), we claim that \( L = X \cap \left( -\infty , p - \epsilon \right] \), this is the case because for any element \( s \in B \left( p, \epsilon \right) \) it's true that \( s \notin L \), but also we do know that \( p - \epsilon \in X \), therefore \( L \) is the intersection of two closed sets and therefore closed.</p>
        <p>Since \( L \) is closed then \( \sup \left( L \right) \in L \), if it's the case that \( R = \emptyset \) then we linearly interpolate from \( f \left( \sup \left( L \right) \right) \) to \( 0 \) over \( \left[ \sup \left( L \right) , N \right] \), otherwise \( R \neq \emptyset \) and we linearly interpolate from \( f \left( \sup \left( L \right) \right) \) to \( f \left( \inf \left( R \right) \right) \) over \( x \in \left[ \sup \left( L \right), \inf \left( R \right) \right] \). Note that by doing this it maintains the sup norm.</p>
        <p>The function is continuous as it's a piecewise continuous and at each connection point they are continouous as the left and right limits are equal. Thus \( g \) is a continuous extension of \( f \) on \( \left[ -N, N \right] \), due to this we can apply WAT to \( g \) to obtain a sequence of polynomials whose limit is \( g \), then by restriction the domain of the polynomails to \( X \) then these "new" ones go to \( f \).</p>
