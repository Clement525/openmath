    <div class="proof">
        <p>Assume that \( f \) is continuous at \( a \), now we will prove that \( \lim_{h \to 0} f{\left ( a + h \right )} = f{\left ( a \right )} \). To show this limit exists, we refer the the definition of <span class="knowledge-link" data-href="/analysis\single_variable.html#definition-limit-of-a-function-at-a-point">limit of a function</span>. So let \( \epsilon \in \mathbb{R}^{\gt 0} \), then since \( f \) is continuous at \( a \) then we know there is some \( \delta_{c} \in \mathbb{R}^{\gt 0} \) such that \( \forall x \in d o m \left ( f \right ) , \left | x - a \right | \lt \delta_{c} \implies \left | f{\left ( x \right )} - f{\left ( a \right )} \right | \lt \epsilon \).</p>
        <p>We need to prove that there is some \( \delta \in \mathbb{R}^{\gt 0} \) such that \( \forall h \in d o m \left ( f \right ) , \left | h - 0 \right | \lt \delta \implies \left | f{\left ( a + h \right )} - f{\left ( a \right )} \right | \lt \epsilon \), so suppose that \( h \in \text{dom} \left ( f \right ) \), thus we can also consider the value of \( h + a \in \text{dom} \left ( f \right ) \). Thus by the assumption of continuity, as it holds for all \( x \) in \( \text{dom} \left ( f \right ) \) then \( \left | \left ( h + a \right ) - a \right | \lt \delta_{c} \implies \left | f{\left ( a + h \right )} - f{\left ( a \right )} \right | \lt \epsilon \), therefore taking \( \delta = \delta_{c} \) will complete this direction of the proof.</p>
        <p>Now we work in the other direction, first assuming that \( \lim_{h \to 0} f{\left ( a + h \right )} = f{\left ( a \right )} \) and trying to show that \( f \) is continuous at \( a \), so let \( \epsilon_{c} \in \mathbb{R}^{\gt 0} \), thus since the aformentioned limit exists, then we have some \( \delta \in \mathbb{R}^{\gt 0} \) such that \( \forall h \in \text{dom} \left ( f \right ) , \left | h - 0 \right | \lt \delta \implies \left | f{\left ( h + a \right )} - f{\left ( a \right )} \right | \lt \epsilon_{c} \).</p>
        <p>Working in s similar fashion as in our first direction, we consider the value \( x - a \in \text{dom} \left ( f \right ) \), since the latter statement in the previous paragraph is for all \( h \in \text{dom} \left ( f \right ) \), we can consider \( h = x - a \), which says that \( \left | x - a - 0 \right | \lt \delta \implies \left | f{\left ( x - a + a \right )} - f{\left ( a \right )} \right | \lt \epsilon_{c} \) which is equivalent to \( \left | x - a \right | \lt \delta \implies \left | f{\left ( x \right )} - f{\left ( a \right )} \right | \lt \epsilon_{c} \), which is exactly what we wanted to prove.</p>
