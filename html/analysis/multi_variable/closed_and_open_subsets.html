                        Note that for any point \( x \in \mathbb{ R } \setminus S  \), what we will do is that we will assume there was a sequence that converges to \( x \) then if it can be shown that there exists an epsilon ball which is completely disjoint from \( S \) then \( x \) certainly cannot be a limit point creating a contradiction. If this can be done for all points in \( \mathbb{ R }  \setminus S \) then it will have show that \( S \) already contains all of its limit points.

                        Formally if \( x \in \mathbb{ R } \setminus S \) then if \( x \notin \left[ 0, 1 \right]  \) and if \( x \gt 1 \) we can use \( \epsilon = \frac{x - 1}{2}  \) and if \( x \lt 0 \) then we can use \( \epsilon = \frac{\left\lvert x \right\rvert}{2}   \). Otherwise \( x \in \left[ 0, 1 \right]  \), but we also know that \( x \notin \left\{ \frac{1}{n} : n \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \right\} \cup \left\{ 0 \right\}   \), so certainly \( x \notin \left\{ 0, 1 \right\}  \) and moreover what can be observed is that there exists a \( k \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \) such that \( x \in \left( \frac{1}{k} , \frac{1}{k + 1}  \right)  \), thus by taking \( \epsilon = \frac{\min \left( x - \frac{1}{k + 1 }, \frac{1}{k} - x  \right) }{2} \), we can find an epsilon ball that completely excludes any points from \( S \) so \( x \) cannot be a limit point.

So suppose that \( \left( z _ n  \right): \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \to L + M  \) is a sequence that converges to a point \( z \) then we want to show that \( z \in L + M \).

                    <p>
                        Note that for any \( k \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \) there must exist some \( l _ k, m _ k \in L, M \) respectively such that \( z _ k = l _ k + m _ k \). So we can  consider \( \left( m _ n \right): \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \to M  \), since \( M \) is compact then there exists some \( m _ { \sigma \left( n \right)  } : \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \to M \) such that \( \left( m _ { \sigma \left( n \right)  }  \right) \to m  \) where \( m \in M \).

                    <p>
                        Next consider the sequence \( z _ { \sigma \left( n \right)  } := l _ { \sigma \left( n \right)  } + m _ { \sigma \left( n \right)  }    \), since \( \left( z _ n \right)  \) converges then so does \( \left( z _ { \sigma \left( n \right)  }  \right)   \), as just discussed \( \left( m _ { \sigma \left( n \right)  }  \right)  \) converges, <a class="knowledge-link" href="/analysis/multi_variable/closed_and_open_subsets.html#lemma-forced-convergence-of-a-summand">therefore</a> \( l _ { \sigma \left( n \right)  }  \) converges, but \( L \) is closed so it converges to a point \( l \in L \).

                    <p>
                        Thus we can see that \( \left( l _ { \sigma \left( n \right)  } \right) \to l   \), \( \left( m _ { \sigma \left( n \right)  } \right) \to m   \) therefore we know that \( \left( z _ { \sigma \left( n \right)  }  \right) \to m + l  \). Recall that we assumed that \( \left( z _ n \right) \to z  \), and we know that any subsequence also converges to \( z \) which implies that \( z = m + l \) thus since \( m \in M \) and \( l \in L \) we know that \( z \in M + L \) as needed.

                         Let \( J := \left\{ n + \frac{1}{n} : n \in \mathbb{ N }   \right\}  \) represent the set on the left hand side. To see why it is closed, evaluate the few first terms to see \( 1 + 1, 2 + \frac{1}{2}, 3 + \frac{1}{3}, \ldots \), we'll show that for any \( x \neq  y \in J, \left\lvert x - y \right\rvert \ge \frac{1}{2} \), we'll first cover the case \( x = 1 + 1, y = 2 + \frac{1}{2}  \) (wlog) and so \( \left\lvert x - y \right\rvert = \left\lvert 2 - 2.5 \right\rvert = \frac{1}{2} \ge \frac{1}{2}   \) as needed, now suppose that \( x = l + \frac{1}{l} \) and \( y = m + \frac{1}{m} \) such that \( l, m \ge 2 \) where without loss of generality we have \( l \lt m \) therefore we know that \( \frac{1}{m} \lt \frac{1}{l}  \), from this we conclude that
                        \[
                            \left\lvert x - y  \right\rvert = \left\lvert m - l + \left( \frac{1}{l} - \frac{1}{m}  \right)  \right\rvert \ge 1 \ge \frac{1}{2} 
                        \]
                        thus for any \( x \in \mathbb{ R } \setminus J \) by using \( \epsilon = \frac{1}{4}  \) we can get a contradiction if such a limit were to exist, thus \( J \) is closed.

                    <p>
                        The right hand side (which we will denote by \( K \))  is closed as well for the even simpler \( \epsilon = \frac{1}{2}  \)

                    <p>
                        But their sum is certainly not closed, because \( 0 \notin J + K \) but \( \left\{ \frac{1}{n} : n \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \right\} \subseteq J + K \), this means that \( 0 \) is a limit point which is not contained in \( J + K \), so \( J + K \) is not closed.

                        Suppose for the sake of contradiction that \( \left( a _ n \right)  \) does not converge to \( a \), thus there exists some \( \epsilon  \in \mathbb{ R } ^ +  \) such that for any \( N \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \) there exists an \( n \ge N \) and \( \lVert a _ n - a \rVert \ge \epsilon   \).

                        Thus for \( N = 1 \) we obtain some \( n _ 1 \) such that \( \lVert a _ { n _ 1 }  - a \rVert \gt \epsilon   \), then recursively, by setting \( N = n _ { i }  \) we obtain some \( n _ { i + 1 }  \) for \( i \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \) such that \( \lVert a _ { n _ { i + 1  }  } - a  \rVert \ge \epsilon   \), by doing this we obtain that \( n _ k \le n _ { k + 1  }  \) for all \( k \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \), so that we've constructed a subsequence \( a _ { n _ k }  \) such that for any \( k \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \)  we have that
                        \[

                        But as per assumption since \( \left( a _ { n _ k }  \right)  \) is a subsequence then it has a sub-subsequence that converges to \( a \), but this is clearly impossible since all elements of this subsequence stay at least \( \epsilon  \) away from \( a \). Therefore it must be that \( \left( a _ n \right) \to a  \)
