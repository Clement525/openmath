                        Note that for any point \( x \in \mathbb{ R } \setminus S  \), what we will do is that we will assume there was a sequence that converges to \( x \) then if it can be shown that there exists an epsilon ball which is completely disjoint from \( S \) then \( x \) certainly cannot be a limit point creating a contradiction. If this can be done for all points in \( \mathbb{ R }  \setminus S \) then it will have show that \( S \) already contains all of its limit points.

                        Formally if \( x \in \mathbb{ R } \setminus S \) then if \( x \notin \left[ 0, 1 \right]  \) and if \( x \gt 1 \) we can use \( \epsilon = \frac{x - 1}{2}  \) and if \( x \lt 0 \) then we can use \( \epsilon = \frac{\left\lvert x \right\rvert}{2}   \). Otherwise \( x \in \left[ 0, 1 \right]  \), but we also know that \( x \notin \left\{ \frac{1}{n} : n \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \right\} \cup \left\{ 0 \right\}   \), so certainly \( x \notin \left\{ 0, 1 \right\}  \) and moreover what can be observed is that there exists a \( k \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \) such that \( x \in \left( \frac{1}{k} , \frac{1}{k + 1}  \right)  \), thus by taking \( \epsilon = \frac{\min \left( x - \frac{1}{k + 1 }, \frac{1}{k} - x  \right) }{2} \), we can find an epsilon ball that completely excludes any points from \( S \) so \( x \) cannot be a limit point.

                        \( \implies  \) Suppose that \( \operatorname{ im } \left( f \right)  \) is infinite, and we'll show that the latter holds, to do so assume the negation of the latter is true and we'll show that this leads to a contradiction, so suppose that there exists an \( X, Y \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \) such that for any \( x \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \), \( x \ge X \implies f \left( x \right) \lt Y \), that this shows is that \( \left\{ f \left( k \right): k \ge X  \right\} \subseteq \left[ 1, \ldots Y \right] \), showing that \( \left\lvert \left\{ f \left( k \right) : k \ge X \right\}  \right\rvert \le Y \)  on the other hand \( \left\{ f \left( n \right): n \in \left[ 1, \ldots X - 1 \right]   \right\}  \) is a subset of \( \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \) of size at most \( x - 1 \), therefore we conclude that

                        \begin{align}

                        \left\lvert \operatorname{ im } \left( f \right)  \right\rvert &=  \left\lvert \left\{ f \left( x \right) : x \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \right\} \right\rvert \\
                        &= \left\lvert \left\{ f \left( n \right) : n \in \left[ 1, \ldots X - 1 \right]  \right\} \cup \left\{ f \left( k \right) : k \ge X \right\}  \right\rvert \\

                        \]
                        which is a contradiction since we assumed that \( \operatorname{ im } \left( f \right)  \) was infinite, thus we must have that with respect to the original statement the latter must hold true, as needed.

                        In order to do so we have to show that \( A \) contains all of its limit points, let \( \left( x _ n \right): \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \to A \) be a sequence such that \( \left( x _ n \right) \to x  \) let's prove that \( x \in A \).

                        If \( \left\{ x _ n: n \in \mathbb{ N } _  1 \right\}  \) is finite, then it converges to a point in \( \left\{ x _ n : n \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \right\} \subseteq A \) as needed.

                        On the other hand if \( \left\{ x _ n: n \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \right\}  \) is infinite, then that shows that \( A \) must be infinite as well, speficially that \( \left\{ a _ n : n  \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \right\}  \) is infinite, moreover we can see that \( \left\{ x _ n : n \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \right\} \subseteq A  \), our goal will be to show that \( x = a \) which can be done by showing that for any \( \epsilon  \in \mathbb{ R } ^ +  \) we have that \( \lVert x - a \rVert \lt \epsilon \). To start things off let \( \epsilon \in \mathbb{ R } ^ +  \):

                    <p>
                        Given \( \left( x _ n \right)  \) we can create a subsequence \( \left( y _ n \right)  \) which is the same, but it omits any element such that \( x _ i = a \), firstly note that \( \left\{ y _ n : n \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \right\} = \left\{ x _ n : n \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \right\} \setminus \left\{ a \right\}\) and thus still has infinite size. By doing this see that for any \( k \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \) we have that \( y _ k = a _ { f \left( k \right) }   \) where \( f: \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \to \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \) is a function (not necessarily increasing), but must have an infinite image, otherwise \( \left\{ y _ n: n \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \right\}  \) would be finite.

                    <p>
                        Since \( \left( x _ n  \right) \to x  \) then we know that \( \left( y _ n \right) \to x  \) since it's subsequence. Now using \( \frac{\epsilon}{2} \), then we get some \( N ^ \prime  \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \) such that for any \( n \ge N ^ \prime  \) we have that \( \lVert y _ n - x \rVert = \lVert a _ { f \left( k \right)  } - x  \rVert \lt \frac{\epsilon }{2}  \)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand we know that \( \left( a _ n \right) \to a  \) and therefore for that same choice of epsilon we obtain some \( N \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \) such that for any \( n \ge N \) we have that \( \lVert a _ n - a \rVert \lt  \frac{\epsilon }{2}   \).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now since \( f \) has infinite image, <a class="knowledge-link" href="/analysis/multi_variable/closed_and_open_subsets.html#lemma-function-on-naturals-with-infinite-image-characterization">then we know that</a> there is an \( x \ge N  \) such that \( f \left( x \right) \ge N ^ \prime  \) therefore we see that 
                        \[
                            \lVert a _ { f \left( x \right)  } - a  \rVert \lt \frac{\epsilon }{2}  \text{ and }  \lVert a _ { f \left( x \right)  } - x  \rVert \lt \frac{\epsilon }{2}
                        \]
                        by adding the two inequalities and moving left using the triangle inequality we obtain that \( \lVert x - a \rVert \lt \epsilon    \) so that \( x = a \), and thus \( x \in A \) so \( A \) is closed.

                        We want to prove that \( L + M \) is closed, so in order to do that we have to show that it contains all of its limit points. So suppose that \( \left( z _ n  \right): \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \to L + M  \) is a sequence that converges to a point \( z \) then we want to show that \( z \in L + M \).

                    <p>
                        Note that for any \( k \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \) there must exist some \( l _ k, m _ k \in L, M \) respectively such that \( z _ k = l _ k + m _ k \). So we can  consider \( \left( m _ n \right): \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \to M  \), since \( M \) is compact then there exists some \( m _ { \sigma \left( n \right)  } : \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \to M \) such that \( \left( m _ { \sigma \left( n \right)  }  \right) \to m  \) where \( m \in M \).

Recall that we assumed that \( \left( z _ n \right) \to z  \), and we know that any subsequence also converges to \( z \) which implies that \( z = m + l \) thus since \( m \in M \) and \( l \in L \) we know that \( z \in M + L \) as needed.

                         Let \( J := \left\{ n + \frac{1}{n} : n \in \mathbb{ N }   \right\}  \) represent the set on the left hand side. To see why it is closed, evaluate the few first terms to see \( 1 + 1, 2 + \frac{1}{2}, 3 + \frac{1}{3}, \ldots \), we'll show that for any \( x \neq  y \in J, \left\lvert x - y \right\rvert \ge \frac{1}{2} \), we'll first cover the case \( x = 1 + 1, y = 2 + \frac{1}{2}  \) (wlog) and so \( \left\lvert x - y \right\rvert = \left\lvert 2 - 2.5 \right\rvert = \frac{1}{2} \ge \frac{1}{2}   \) as needed, now suppose that \( x = l + \frac{1}{l} \) and \( y = m + \frac{1}{m} \) such that \( l, m \ge 2 \) where without loss of generality we have \( l \lt m \) therefore we know that \( \frac{1}{m} \lt \frac{1}{l}  \), from this we conclude that
                        \[
                            \left\lvert x - y  \right\rvert = \left\lvert m - l + \left( \frac{1}{l} - \frac{1}{m}  \right)  \right\rvert \ge 1 \ge \frac{1}{2}

                        thus for any \( x \in \mathbb{ R } \setminus J \) by using \( \epsilon = \frac{1}{4}  \) we can get a contradiction if such a limit were to exist, thus \( J \) is closed.

                        But their sum is certainly not closed, because \( 0 \notin J + K \) but \( \left\{ \frac{1}{n} : n \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \right\} \subseteq J + K \), this means that \( 0 \) is a limit point which is not contained in \( J + K \), so \( J + K \) is not closed.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the empty set is the largest open set contained within \( \mathbb{ Q }  \), since there are no smaller sets we deduce that the empty set is the only open set contained within \( \mathbb{ Q }  \).

                    <p>
                        Let \( U \subseteq \mathbb{ Q } \) be an open set, we'll prove that \( U \) is the empty set. note that if \( x \) were irrational and \( x \in U \) then \( x \in \mathbb{ Q }  \) which is a contradiction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now suppose that there was an \( a \in U \) for contradiction, this implies that there is an interval \( \left( i _ 1, i _ 2 \right)  \) such that \( a \in \left( i _ 1, i _ 2 \right) \subseteq U  \), but since \( i _ 1, i _ 2 \in \mathbb{ Q } \subseteq \mathbb{ R }  \) we know that there is an irrational number \( x \in \left( i _ 1, i _ 2 \right)  \) this implies that \( x \in U \) which is a contradiction, so there is no such \( a \). Therefore \( U = \emptyset \) as needed.

                Note that the above proves that even if a set has empty interior it may not be closed.

                        We want to show that \( A \cap U \) is dense in \( U \) which is to say that \( U \subseteq \overline{ A \cap U }  \), thus let \( u \in U \) we want to construct a sequence \( \left( x _ n \right): \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \to A \cap U  \) such that \( \left( x _ n \right) \to u \).

                        Recall that \( A \) was dense in \( \mathbb{ R } ^ n \) which means that \( \mathbb{ R } ^ n \subseteq A \) in other words \( A = \mathbb{ R } ^ n \), since \( u \in U \subseteq \mathbb{ R } ^ n \) then \( u \in \mathbb{ R } ^ n \) and thus there exists a sequence \( \left( a _ n    \right): \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \to A  \) such that \( \left( a _ n \right) \to u \).

                    <p>
                        On the other hand we know that \( U \) is open and thus there is some \( \epsilon \in \mathbb{ R } ^ +  \) such that \( B \left( u, \epsilon \right) \subseteq U \). Using this \( \epsilon  \) in the fact that \( \left( a _ n \right) \to u  \) we see that there is some \( N \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1\) such that for all \( n \ge N \) we have that \( \lVert a _ n - u \rVert \lt \epsilon \iff a _ n \in B \left( u, \epsilon  \right)   \).

                    <p>
                        With all this in mind we construct \( x _ n = a _ { N + n }  \) so that we have \( x _ n \in A \cap B \left( u, \epsilon  \right)  \subseteq A \cap U  \) moreover, since \( \left( x _ n \right)  \) is a subsequence \( \left( a _ n \right)  \) then we know that \( \left( x _ n \right) \to u  \) as needed.

                Note that this proposition states that once you intersect with an open set, the intersection automatically gets some space (by the epsilon) ball, with knowing if \( U \) was open, this would not have worked, because we might not have gotten that space, in particular consider \( \left[ 0, 1 \right] \subseteq \mathbb{ R }  \) which is dense, and \( U = \left[ 1, 2 \right]  \) which is not open, then their intersection is \( \left\{ 1 \right\}  \) which is not dense in \( \left[ 1, 2 \right]  \)

                Consider the cluster points of \( \mathbb{ Q }  \), since there are infinitely many elements nearby to any other element, then these coincide exactly with the collection of limit points. On the other hand if we consider \( \mathbb{ Z }  \) we start to see a difference, for limit points we see that for any \( z \in \mathbb{ Z }  \) the constant sequence converges to \( z \), on the other hand such a sequence is not possible for a cluster point as it strictly requires sequences such that output to \( \mathbb{ Z } \setminus \left\{ z \right\}  \) making it impossible to converge there, thus the collection of cluster points is just \( \emptyset  \) whereas the limit points are still \( \mathbb{ Z }  \). Finally for the set \( \left( 0, 1 \right)  \) the limit points and cluster points are the same, for similar reasons as discussed with \( \mathbb{ Q }  \).
