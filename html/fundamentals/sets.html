		Suppose we wrote out the set `{a, b, c, d}` and then later on realized that `a = b = c = d`, then this set is simply `{a, a, a, a}`, which we define to just be `{a}`. Therefore we allow duplicates when declaring a set, but realize the set it generates has no such duplicate, so `{1, 1, 1} = {1, 1} = {1}`

					<p>
						Note that the integers `-1, 0, 1` show that the empty set is not in this family. We'll now prove that it's union equals `ZZ`, so let `p in bigcup P`, therefore `p` is in at least one of the sets included in `P`, since each is a subset of `ZZ`, then we know `p in ZZ`, for the reverse direction, we can assume that `p in ZZ`, therefore we know that `p` is either positive, negative or zero, so that `p in bigcup P`, <a class="knowledge-link" href="/fundamentals/sets.html#proposition-set-equality-by-subsets">this shows </a> `bigcup P = ZZ`.
					</p>
					<p>
						To show this family is pairwise disjoint, note that `0 notin {p in ZZ: p < 0}` and `0 notin {p in ZZ: p > 0}`, which shows us that `{0} nn {p in ZZ: p < 0} = O/` and `{0} nn {p in ZZ: p > 0} = O/`.
					</p>
					<p>
						Given any positive integer, we know it cannot be a negative integer, therefore `{p in ZZ: p < 0} nn {p in ZZ: p> 0} = O/`, thus we know that `P` is pairwise disjoint, which concludes the proof.
