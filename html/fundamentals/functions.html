			</div>
			<div class="proof">
				<p>
					We'll show that `g circ f` is surjective first, so let `c in C`, since `g` is bijective we get some `b in B` such that `g (b) = c`, since `b in B`, then since `f` is surjective we get some `a in A` such that `f(a) = b`, thus `g circ f (a) = g(f(a)) = g(b) = c` so then `g circ f` is surjective
				</p>
				<p>
					Now let's show that `g circ f`  is injective, so suppose that `a_1, a_2 in A` and assume that `g circ f (a_1) = g @ f (a_2)`, note that this means `g(f(a_1)) = g(f(a_2))`, therefore since `g` is injective we know that `f(a_1) = f(a_2)` and since `f` is injective then we know that `a_1 = a_2` as needed.
