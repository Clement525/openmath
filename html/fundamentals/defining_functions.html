<p>Whenever we attempt define a function using any sort of rule, we may not have actually defined one. To understand this we'll take an example</p>
<p>Let \( f : \mathbb{ Z } \times \mathbb{ Z } \to \mathbb{ Z } \) be a binary operation on \( \mathbb{ Z } \) defined as \( f \left( x, y \right) = x + y \). This should make sense to you, but there's hidden meaning behind some of the symbols here.</p>
<p>First of all when we state that \( f \) is a binary operation, we've assumed that it's a function, which means that given two tuples \( \mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{ Z } \times \mathbb{ Z } \), we know that if \( \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{b} \) then \( f \left( \mathbf{a} \right) = f \left( \mathbf{b} \right) \). After this, we then define what happens to any input pairs through an equation, it's possible that whatever definition we give may end up breaking the definition of a function.</p>
<p>Usually we don't have to check for things like that this because we know that the addition operation we are used to dealing with already is a function so \( f \) simply acts like a wrapper. In general when we write stuff like the above paragraph it's because we a priori know that what we're working with will certainly be a function.</p>
<p>If we were pedantic, then whenever we make a definition like this we'd note that we've simply created a relation, and it's up to us to prove that indeed it defines a function.</p>
<p>This is usually not a problem until you start defining attempting to define a functions in more complex ways. For example let \( g: \mathbb{ Z } \to \mathbb{ Z } \) be a function (nothing to check here), and let's redefine our original \( f \) like this \( f \left( g \left( a \right), g \left( b \right) \right) = a + b \) . Right away we can see that this is not our standard way of defining functions, but perhaps this defines a function.</p>
<p>Note that \( a, b \) are not actually inputs into \( f \), but rather \( g \left( a \right) \) and \( g \left( b \right) \) are inputs into \( f \), so that if we knew that \( g \) was invertible we could say that \( f \left( x, y \right) = g ^ { -1 } \left( x \right) + g ^ { -1 } \left( y \right) \), for this we'd also need that \( g \) be onto or else there may be some \( x, y \) pair that isn't being defined here.</p>
<p>Before moving note that if \( g \)'s domain and co-domain contained elements that were not in \( \mathbb{ Z } \) that would be an issue because then there would exists an input or output for which the function is undefined because of \( f \)'s domain or definition of addition on \( \mathbb{ Z } \).</p>
<p>Again, to verify that this defines a function, we'd first have to make sure that \( g \) is surjective, because if it is not, then we have not defined all points in \( f \)'s domain. Now suppose that \( g \left( 1 \right) = g \left( 2 \right) = g \left( 3 \right) = 0 \), then we'd see \( f \left( g \left( 1 \right) , g \left( 2 \right) \right) = 1 + 2 = 3 \) and then \( f \left( g \left( 2 \right) , g \left( 3 \right) \right) = 2 + 3 = 5 \).</p>
<p>The mistake here is that since all of those \( g \) inputs equal zero we've just stated \( f \left( 0, 0 \right) = 3 \) and that \( f \left( 0, 0 \right) = 5 \), which clearly doesn't define a function. It's obfuscated because the inputs to \( g \) are different, so you might conflate \( f \left( g \left( 2 \right) , g \left( 3 \right) \right) = 3 \) with \( f \left( 2, 3 \right) = 3 \) without realizing it.</p>
<p>This conflation is exacerbated when the notation for \( g \) is minimal, for example supposed we redefined \( f \) to be \( f : \mathbb{ C } \times \mathbb{ C } \to \mathbb{ C } \) via \( f \left( \overline{ a } , \overline{ b } \right) = \overline{ a + b } \) where we're working with the complex conjugate. In this situation we can verify that this happens to work out, but note that we no longer look at this function definition the same way as we naively did before</p>
<p>Conjecture let \( f: X \times X \to K \) be a relation, suppose that \( g: X \to X \) is a function which is not injective, and \( h: X \times X \to K \) is injective, then the following definition \( f \left( g \left( a \right), g \left( b \right) \right) = h \left( a, b \right) \) cannot define a function.</p>
<p>Proof: Since \( g \) is not injective then there exists a pair of values \( s \neq t \in \mathbb{ Z } \) such that \( c := g \left( s \right) = g \left( t \right) \), now observe that \( f \left( g \left( r \right) , g \left( r \right) \right) = h \left( r, r \right) \neq h \left( r, s \right) = f \left( g \left( r \right) , g \left( s \right) \right) \), which has shown that \( g \left( c, c \right) \neq g \left( c, c \right) \). The central not equals sign comes from the fact that \( h \) was injective.</p>
<p>Conjecture let \( f: X \times X \to K \) be a relation, suppose that \( g: X \to X \) is an injective and surjective function, and \( h: X \times X \to K \) is just injective, then the following definition \( f \left( g \left( a \right), g \left( b \right) \right) = h \left( a, b \right) \) defines a function</p>
