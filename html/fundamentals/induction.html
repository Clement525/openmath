					Suppose that `a in ZZ` and `P(k): ZZ^(ge a) to { bb T, bb F}`  is a predicate, if `P(a)` holds true and `P(k) implies P(k + 1)`, then `P(k)` holds true for all `k in ZZ^(ge a)`
				</div>

				<div class="proof">
					Let `k in ZZ^(ge a)`, if `k = a`, then we know that `P(k)` is true, otherwise if `k > a`, then `k = a + r` for some `r in NN_1`, therefore `P(a) implies P(a + 1)`, so we know that `P(a + 1)` is true, then applying the same reasonging `P(a + 1) implies P(a + 2)` so `P(a + 2)` is true, thus we can see that after `r` iterations of that `P(a + r) = P(k)` is also true.

					Suppose that `(x_n)_(n in NN_0)` is a sequence such that for any `k in NN_1` we have `x_k := a x_(k - 1) + b`, where `a, b in RR`, prove that 
					<div class="centered-content">
						`x_k = a^k (x_0 - b / (1 - a)) + b / (1 - a)`
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="proof">
					<p>
						We proceed with a proof by induction so let `k in NN_1`, suppose that `k = 1`, thus by the definition of `x_1` we know it's equal to `a * x_0 + b`, now some algebra: `a * x_0 + b = a * x_0 + b ((1 - a) / (1 - a)) = a^1 * x_0 - (ba) / (1 - a) + b / (1 - a) = a^k (x_0 - b / (1 - a)) + b/(1 - a)`, which is what we needed to show.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now for the induction step, so suppose that `k > 1` and that `x_k = a^k (x_0 - b / (1 - a)) + b / (1 - a)` holds true (and call it our Induction Hypothesis), we'll now show that `x_(k + 1) =  a^(k + 1) (x_0 - b / (1 - a)) + b / (1 - a)`.
					</p>
					<p>
						First recall the very definition of `x_(k + 1)` which is that `x_(k + 1) = a x_(k) + b`, but from our induction hypothesis, we know that `x_k = a^k (x_0 - b / (1 - a)) + b / (1 - a)`, so therefore `x_(k + 1) = a [a^k (x_0 - b / (1 - a)) + b / (1 - a)] + b`.
					</p>
					<p>
						We'll start by multiplying everything out and then seeing what we get:  ` a [a^k (x_0 - b / (1 - a)) + b / (1 - a)] + b = a^(k + 1)(x_0 - b / (1 - a)) + (ab) / (1 - a) + b = a^(k + 1)(x_0 - b / (1 - a)) + (ab) / (1 - a) + b ((1 - a) / (1 - a)) ` `= a^(k + 1)(x_0 - b / (1 - a)) + (ab  + b - ab) / (1 - a)` `= a^(k + 1)(x_0 - b / (1 - a)) +  b / (1 - a) ` which is exactly what we set out to prove.
					</p>
					<p>
						Therefore since the statement holds for `k = 1`, and if when it holds for `k` then it also holds for `k + 1`, then the statement is true for all `k in NN_1`, as needed.
