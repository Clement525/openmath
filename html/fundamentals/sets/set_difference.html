					Suppose that `p in (A \\ B) nn X` so `p in A`, `p notin B` and `p in X`, this means that `p in A nn X` and `p notin B nn X`, this shows that `p in (A nn X) \\ (B nn X)` as needed

				<p>
					Now suppose that `p in (A nn X) \\ (B nn X)` so `p in A`, `p in X` but `p notin B nn X`, since we know that `p in X`, to avoid contradiction we must have `p notin B` with this information, we can se that `p in (A \\ B) nn X`, as needed.

					We know that `x in A \\  (B nn C) ` is true iff `x in A` and `x notin (B nn C)`, equivalent to `x notin B` or `x notin C`, since `x in A`, we can biconditionally re-write this as `x in A \\ B` or `x in A \\ C` iff `x in (A \\ B) uu (A \\ C)`

				Suppose that `M` is a family of sets, then `X \\ (bigcup_(A in M) A) = bigcap_(A in M) (X \\ A)` and `X \\ (bigcap_(A in M) A) = bigcup_(A in M) (X \\ A)`

				<p>
					Note that, `p in X \\ (bigcup_(A in M) A)`, if and only if  `p in X` and `x notin bigcup_(A in M) A`, which is equivalent to: for all `A in M` `p notin A`, which is the same as `p in (X \\ A)` for each `A in M`, so by definition `p in bigcap_(A in M) (X \\ A)`. Since each connective in the previous paragraph was an iff, then this implies the two sets are equal
				</p>
				<p>
					For the second proof, we'll follow a similar structure to the first. Note that, `p in X \\ (bigcap_(A in M) A)`, if and only if  `p in X` and `x notin bigcap_(A in M) A`, which is equivalent to: there is some `A in M` `p notin A`, which is the same as `p in (X \\ A)` for some `A in M`, so by definition `p in bigcup_(A in M) (X \\ A)`. Since each connective in the previous paragraph was an iff, then this implies the two sets are equal

		When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
		\[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\]
