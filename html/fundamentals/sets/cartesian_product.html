					Suppose that `(x,y) in (A xx B) nn (C xx D)`, which is true iff `(x,y) in (A xx B)`, so that `x in A` and `y in B`.
				</p>
				<p>
					We also know that `(x,y) in (C xx D)` which is equivalent to `x in C` and `y in D`

				<p>
					We have `x in A nn C` and `y in B nn D` which is equivalent to `(x,y) in (A nn C) xx (B nn D)`.

					Thus we've proven that `(x,y) in (A xx B) nn (C xx D)` if and only if `(x, y) in (A xx B) nn (C xx D)` as needed.

				Given sets `A, B, C`, then `(A nn B) xx C = (A xx C) nn (B xx C)`
			</div>
			<div class="proof">
				We will show their equality <a class="knowledge-link" href="/fundamentals/sets/basics.html#definition-set-equality">directly</a>
				<p>
					So suppose that `(x, y) in (A nn B) xx C`, which is true iff `x in A nn B` and `y in C`, which is true iff `(x, y) in A xx C` and `(x, y) in B xx C`, which is true iff `x in (A xx C) nn (B xx C)`.
				</p>
				<p>
					Therefore `(x, y) in (A nn B) xx C` if and only if `x in (A xx C) nn (B xx C)`, so `(A nn B) xx C = (A xx C ) nn (B xx C)` as needed.
