        	    A public key cryptosystem is a crypotsystem such that there are two keys, a public key which anyone can know used for encoding, and a private key which only a decoder knows .

        <p>
            Each person has a pair of keys \( \left( e, d \right)  \), and publishes that in a directory which everyone can see, and they keep their private key \( d \) on their system.
        </p>

        <p>
            If A wants to send a message to B, they look up B's public key in the directory and then encrypt their plaintext message using it to produce the ciphertext.
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to decipher the message, one has to decrypt it using B's private key which means that no-one else can read messages intended for B.

                    Suppose you want to allow someone to send you a message on your computer securely using the RSA protocol, then you do the following:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Start with two large primes \(p, q\). Compute \(n=p q\) and \(\phi(n)=(p-1)(q-1)\).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Choose some \(1 \leq e \leq \phi(n)\) relatively prime to \(\phi(n)\) and compute an inverse \(d\) to \(e\) modulo \(\phi(n)\) (i.e., \(d e \equiv 1(\bmod \phi(n)))\).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The public key is \((e, n)\), the private key is \(d\).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        From the point of view of a sender, to send a message, they take that message and break it into blocks which can be encoded as numbers \(1 \leq m \leq n\). They send each block as a ciphertext given by \(c := m^e ~\%~ n \)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To decipher a ciphertext \(c\), compute \(m \equiv c^d(\bmod n)\).
                    </li>
                </ol>

        	<div class="title">Why Raising the Ciphertext to the Power of The Private Key Yields the Plaintext</div>
        	<div class="content">
        		Suppose that \( c \) is the ciphertext and \( d \) is the private key then the plaintext is given by
                \[
                    c ^ d ~\%~ n
                \]
        	</div>
        	<div class="proof">
                Recall that \( c = m ^ e ~\%~ n\) therefore we have that 
                \[
                    c ^ d \equiv \left( m ^ e \right) ^ d = m ^ { de } 
                \]
                At the same time we know that \( de \equiv 1 \pmod{ \phi \left( n \right)  } \) therefore \( de = 1 + k \phi \left( n \right)  \) so that 
                \[
                    m ^ { de } = m ^ { 1 + k \phi \left( n \right)  } = m \left( m ^ \phi \left( n \right)  \right) ^ k \equiv m \cdot 1 = m \pmod{ n } 
                \]
