                that \( \gcd \left( a, b \right) = as + bt \), moreover \( \gcd \left( a, b \right) \) is the smallest
                such positive integer of the form \( as + bt \)
            </div>

            <div class="proof">
                <p>Define \( S := \left\{ am + bn: m, n \in \mathbb{ Z } \text{ and } am + bn &gt; 0\right\} \), we
                first note that \( S \) cannot be empty. The only way it could be empty would be if that given any
                choice of \( m, n \) we have \( am + bn &lt; 0 \), but if that&#39;s the case we can always see that \(
                - \left( am + bn \right) &gt; 0 \) and note that \( - \left( am + bn \right) = a \left( -m \right) + b
                \left( -n \right) \), which shows that there is an element in \( S \).</p>

                <p>Since \( S \subseteq \mathbb{ N } _ 0 \), the well ordering principle tells us that there is some
                smallest element of \( S \), say \( d = a j + b k \). We will prove that \( \gcd \left( a, b \right) =
                d \).</p>

                <p>By the <a class="knowledge-link" href=
                "/number_theory/division.html#theorem-quotient-remainder">quotient remainder theorem</a>, we have some
                \( q, r \) such that \( a = qd + r \) where \( 0 \le r &lt; d \), from here we can see that \[
                \begin{aligned} r &amp;= a - qd \\ &amp;= a - q \left( aj + bk \right) \\ &amp;= a \left( 1 - qj
                \right) + b \left( qk \right) \end{aligned} \] at this point in time if \( r &gt; 0 \), then we would
                have a contradiction because \( r \) would be a value smaller than \( d \) that is an element of \( S
                \), but we assumed that \( d \) was the smallest such element. Therefore, the only way forward is that
                \( r = 0 \)</p>

                <p>If \( r = 0 \), then \( a = qd \) meaning that \( d \) divides \( a \), by copying the above text
                and replacing the variable \( a \) with \( b \) we obtain a proof that \( d \) divides \( b \) as well.
                To complete showing that \( d = \gcd \left( a, b \right) \) we need to prove that \( d \) is the
                smallest divisor.</p>

                <p>Suppose that \( m \) is another common divisor of \( a, b \), then we have \( k_a, k_b \in \mathbb{

                + bk = \left( k_a m \right) j + \left( k_b m \right) k = m \left( k_a j + k_b k \right) \), this shows

                    Now suppose that there is some \( m \in \mathbb{ Z } ^ + \) such that \( a , b \mid m \) in other words there exists some \( k _ a, k _ b \in  \mathbb{ Z }  \) such that \( m = a k _ a = b k _ b \) we'll show that \( l \le m \). Recall that \( d \mid a, b \) and so we get some \( \alpha , \beta \in  \mathbb{ Z }  \) such that \( a = \alpha d \) and \( b = \beta d \) therfore
                    \[
                    m = a k _ a = b k _ b \iff \left( \alpha d \right) k _ a = \left( \beta d \right) k _ b \iff \alpha k _ a = \beta k _ b

                <p>
                    The above equation shows that \( \alpha \mid \beta k _ b \) and \( \beta \mid \alpha k _ a \), but note that \( \gcd \left( \alpha , \beta \right) = \gcd \left( \frac{a}{d} , \frac{b}{d}  \right) = 1   \) therefore by the previous proposition we must have that \( \alpha \mid k _ b \) and \( \beta \mid k _ a \) therefore there is some \( j \in \mathbb{ Z }  \) such that \( k _ b = j \alpha \) thus finally
                    \[
                        m = b k _ b = b j \alpha = b \left( \frac{a}{d}  \right) j = l j

                    therefore \( l \mid m \) so that \( l \le m \). Therefore \( l = \frac{ab}{g}  \) and thus \( g l = ab \) as needed.
