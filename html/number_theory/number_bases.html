				Let \( b \in \mathbb{ N } _ 2 \) and \( n \in \mathbb{ N } _ 0 \) then there exists a \( k \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1 \) and \( a _ 1, \ldots , a _ k \in \left[ 0, \ldots , b - 1 \right]  \) such that

			<div class="proof">
				<p>
					Let \( b \in \mathbb{ N } _ 2 \) and we continue with induction. In the base case when \( n = 0 \) then the representation \( \left( 0 \right) _ b  \) works. Now let \( j \in \mathbb{ N } _ 0 \) and and let \( i \in \left[ 0, \ldots, j \right]  \) and assume that it holds for \( i \), now we'll show it holds true for \( j + 1  \).
				</p>
				<p>
					What we will try to do is extract the largest \( b ^ m \) we can from \( j + 1  \) and then use the induction hypothesis. So let \( J := \left\{ m \in \mathbb{ N } _ 1: b ^ m \le j + 1 \right\}  \), this set has a maximum element because \( j + 1  \) is an upper bound, it is because we know that \( 1 \le j + 1 \le 2 ^ { j + 1  } \le b ^ { j + 1  }  \) therefore \( j + 1 \) is indeed an upper bound to \( J \), let \( l \) be the max element of \( J \) and then by the quotient remainder theorem we have some \( q, r \in \mathbb{ Z }  \) such that
					\[
					    j + 1 = q b ^ l + r \text{ with } 0 \le r \lt b ^ l
					\]
					since \( r \lt b ^ l \le j + 1   \) then the induction hypothesis holds on \( r \) so that \( r \) has a base \( b \)  representation so that
					\[
					    r = \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { p } c _ i b ^ i
					\]
					where \( p \lt l \), because if \( p \ge l \) then that makes \( r = \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { p } x _ i b ^ i \ge b ^ l  \) which is a contradiction since we know that \( r \lt b ^ l \) this means that the representation is exactly
					\[
					    \left( q c _ p \ldots c _ 0 \right) _ b
					\]

			<div class="content">
				For any \( b \in \mathbb{ N } _ 2 \) and \( n \in \mathbb{ N } _ 0  \) there is exactly one base \( b \) representation of \( n \)
			</div>
			<div class="proof">
				<p>
					Let \( b \in \mathbb{ N } _ 2 \) and perform induction on \( n \). So for \( n = 0 \) we know that the representation \( \left( 0 \right) _  b \) and for any other representation where \( a \neq 0 \) then \( \left( a \right) _ b \neq 0 \) there is exactly one representation as needed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now suppose that \( n \in \mathbb{ N } _ 0 \) and that for any \( k \in \left[ 0, \ldots n \right]  \) has a unique base \( b \) representation, let's prove that \( n + 1  \) has a unique base \( b \) representation, for the sake of contradiction suppose that it has two different representations, which implies that
					\[
					    \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { m } a _ i b ^  i = n + 1 = \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { k  } c _ i b ^ i
					\]
					firstly we claim that \( m = k \) for if that were not the case then without loss of generality \( m \lt k \) and note the following
					\[
					    \begin{align}
					        \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { m } a _ i b ^  i &\le \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { m } \left( b - 1 \right) b _ i \\
					&\le \left( b - 1 \right) \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { m } b _ i \\
					&\le \left( b - 1 \right) \frac{b ^ { m + 1  } - 1 }{b - 1} \\
					&= b ^ { m + 1  } - 1 \lt b ^ { m + 1 }
					    \end{align}
					\]
					Note that since \( m \lt k \) we know that \( m + 1 \le k \) then we know that
					\[
					    b ^ { m + 1  } \le b ^ k \le \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { k } c _ i b ^ i
					\]
					which is a contradiction because chaining the last few inequalities we obtain
					\[
					    n + 1  = \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { m } a _ i b ^  i \lt \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { k } c _ i b _ i = n + 1
					\]
					thus we deduce that \( m = k \).
				</p>
				<p>
					Now we additionally claim that \( a _ m = c _ k \) for if that were not the case then without loss of generality we assume that \( a _ m \lt c _ k \) and therefore
					\[
					n - a _ m b ^ m = \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { m } a _ i b ^  i - a _ m b ^ m = \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { m - 1 } a _ i b ^ i
					\]
					but also
					\[
					\begin{align}
					n - a _ m b ^ m &= \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { k } c _ i b ^ i - a _ m b ^ m \\
					&= c _ k b ^ k + \cdots  + \left( c _ m - a _ m  \right) b ^ m + \cdots + c _ 0 b ^ 0
					\end{align}
					\]
					and since \( c _ m - a _ m \gt 0 \) this is valid base \( b \) representation of \( n - a _ m b ^ m \), but clearly they differ as \( a _ k \neq 0 \) and so the length of the two representations are different. This a contradiction because by our induction hypothesis they must have the same base \( b \) representation, therefore our assumption that \( n + 1 \) has two different base \( b \) representations is false and therefore by strong induction the original statement is true.

			<div class="content">
				Given any \( n \in \mathbb{ N } _ 0\) prove that the number of digits in it's base 2 representation is given by
				\[
				    \left\lfloor \log _ 2 \left( n \right)  \right\rfloor + 1
				\]
			</div>
			<div class="proof">
				<p>
					Let \( n \in \mathbb{N} \), suppose  \( n \) requires \( d \) digits in it's base 2 representation, we'd like to show that \(d = \lfloor \log_2(n)  \rfloor+1\).
				</p>

				<p>
					At most we have \(n = 1 \ldots 1\), that is \( d \) 1's in a row. But we know that is
				</p>

				\[
					\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} 2^i = 2^d - 1
				\]

				<p>

					At a minimum the first digit is a 1 and the rest are zeros (since the powers start at 0 right to left, this is \( 2^{d - 1} \)).
				</p>

				<p>
					We now have the following bound  on \( n \).
				</p>

				\[
					2^{d-1 } \le n \le 2^d - 1
				\]

				<p>
					Taking log base 2 on on the above inequality yields: (Call this inequality $\beta$)
				</p>

				\[
					d - 1 \le \log_2 (n) \le \log_2(2^d -1 )
				\]

				<p>
					*Note*: Taking the log respects the inequalities because $\log_2(\cdot)$ is a strictly increasing function (check it's derivative)
				</p>


				<p>
					We will attempt to take the floor of \( \beta \). Since \( d-1 \) is an integer \( \lfloor d-1 \rfloor = d-1 \), as for \( \log_2(2^d-1) \), we must look a little closer.
				</p>

				<p>
					Since \( 2^{d-1} \le 2^d - 1 < 2^d \) and , we know that
				</p>

				\[
					d-1 = \log_2(2^{d-1}) \le \log_2(2^d - 1) < log_2(2^d) = d
				\]

				<p>
					Therefore \(\lfloor \log_2(2^d - 1) \rfloor = d-1 \) and so the result of taking the floor of \(\beta \) yields
				</p>

				\[
					d - 1 \le \lfloor \log_2 (n) \rfloor \le \lfloor \log_2(2^d -1 ) \rfloor = d-1
				\]

				<p>
					In other words
				</p>

				\[
					d - 1 \le \lfloor \log_2 (n) \rfloor \le d-1

				<p> So </p>

				\[
					d - 1 = \lfloor \log_2 (n) \rfloor \Leftrightarrow d = \lfloor \log_2 (n) \rfloor + 1
