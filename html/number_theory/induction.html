                Therefore by contradiction assume that the set \( C \) is not empty, thus by the well ordering principle it has a smallest element \( m \in C \), note that \( m \ge 2 \) because \( P \left( 1 \right)  \) holds  therefore \( m - 1 \notin C \cap \mathbb{ N } _ 0 \) which means that \( P \left( m - 1 \right)  \) which implies that \( 1 + 2 + \cdots + \left( m - 1 \right) = \frac{\left( m - 1 \right) m }{2}   \) then by simply adding \( m \) to both sides we get that
                \[
                    1 + 2 + \cdots + m = \frac{m ^ 2 - m + 2m}{2} = \frac{m ^ 2 + m}{2 } = \frac{m \left( m + 1  \right) }{2 }
                \]
                so thefore \( P \left( m \right)  \) holds, which is a contradiction so therefore \( S = \emptyset  \) as needed.

            <p>
                If this set is not empty then we have some \( a \in \mathbb{ N } _ 0 \) such that \( \neg P \left( a \right)  \) holds true, therefore by <a class="knowledge-link" href="/number_theory/induction.html#proposition-well-ordering-principle">the well ordering principle</a> we know that \( S \) has a minimal element, which we will denote by \( m \) and note that \( m \ge 1 \) because \( P \left( 0 \right)  \) holds true  , so that so that \( m - 1 \in \mathbb{ N  } _ 0  \) and it is minimal so that \( m - 1 \notin S \)  so by definition of \( S \) it means that \( P \left( m - 1\right)  \) holds true, but then by the second property of induction we obtain that \( P \left( m \right)  \) holds true, so therefore \( m \notin S \) which is a contradiction.

            <p>
                Therefore since by assuming that \( S \) is non-empty we get a contradiction, it must mean that \( S \) is empty, which means that for every \( n \in \mathbb{ N } _ 0 \) we have that \( P \left( n \right)  \) holds true, as needed.

                Let \( P \left( n \right)  \) be the predicate that the statement holds true on a graph with \( n \) vertices.  We will show this is true via <a class="knowledge-link" href="/number_theory/induction.html#theorem-induction">induction</a> over \( \mathbb{ N } _ 2 \).
            </p>
            <p>
                For the base case, we have two vertices \( s, t \) , if there are no edges between them it holds vacuously, note that the only other case is that there is one edge, because if there were two then they could only be formed of the edges \( \left( s, t \right) , \left( t, s \right)  \) which would contradict that there is no way to return back to a city you were previously at. Therefore without loss of generality assume that the only edge is \( \left( s, t \right)  \), in that case the statement holds true because \( t \) is the city into which all roads enter and \( s \) is the city from which all roads exit.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the induction step assume the prediate holds true for \( k \in \mathbb{ N } _ 2 \) and we'll prove that it holds true on \( k + 1 \), so supposing we have a graph with \( k + 1 \) nodes, let's obtain the graph by removing one vertex \( x \) and all edges it's involved in, by induction this subgraph has an \( s, t \) such that all roads enter \( s \) and all roads exit \( t \), specifically note that this implies that the edge \( \left( x, s \right)  \) and \( \left( t, x \right)  \) exist in the original graph that contained \( x \).
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that by re-adding in \( x \) the property would be maintained unless \( x \) had an edge \( \left( s , x \right) \), but this would be impossible because the graph has the property that when you leave a city you cannot return to it again, but if we have \( \left( x, s \right), \left( s, x \right)   \) the path \( x - s - x \) contradicts this fact, similarly if an edge \( \left( x, t \right)  \) existed we also get this contradiction, therefore such edges must not exist which shows that the predicate holds true on the graph containing \( x \) by using \( s \) as the sink and \( t \) as the source.

                Let \( Q \left( n \right)  \) be the predicate that \( P \left( j \right)  \) holds true for \( 0 \le j \le n \). We want to prove that \( Q \left( 0 \right)  \) holds true, which is equivalent to \( P \left( 0 \right)  \) being true. Observe that for \( k = 0 \) the assumption of strong induction states that
                \[

                Let \( k \in \mathbb{ N  } _ 0 \) and assume that \( Q \left( k \right)  \) holds true, therefore \( P \left( j \right)  \) holds true for \( 1 \le j \le k \) since \( P \) satisfies the property stated in the statement we are trying to prove, we get that \( P \left( k + 1 \right)  \) holds, which shows that \( Q \left( k + 1 \right)  \) is true.

                Assume the strong induction holds, we want to prove that given any non-empty set \( S \subseteq \mathbb{ N } _ 0 \) then it has a minimum element, we will show this is true by the <a class="knowledge-link" href="/fundamentals/logic.html#proposition-contrapositive">contrapositive</a>, so assume that \( S \) has no min element and we'll show that \( S \) is empty.

                Let \( P \left( n \right)  \) be the predicate which claims that \( n \notin S \). Since \( S \) is bounded below by \( 0 \) then if \( 0 \in S \) then it would be the least element, so \( 0 \notin S \), which shows that \( P \left( 0 \right)  \) holds.

For contradiction suppose that it does not, which means that \( k + 1 \in S \), but since nothing before it is in the set, then that would make it the minimum element, but \( S \) has no minimum element, given this contradiction we know that \( k + 1 \notin S \) and therefore \( P \left( k + 1 \right)  \) is true, thus by strong induction, we know that \( P \left( n \right)  \) holds true for all \( n \in \mathbb{ N } _ 0 \) and therefore since no element is in \( S \) is it empty, as needed.

                Note that if \( P \left( 0 \right) \land P \left( 1 \right) \land \cdots \land P \left( l \right)  \) holds true for \( l \in \mathbb{ N } _ 0 \) then we would be able to conclude that \( P \left( n \right)  \) for all \( n \in \mathbb{ N } _ 0 \), let's prove that this statement is true.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let \( l \in \mathbb{ N } _ 0 \) since \( P \left( n \right)  \) holds true for infinitely many values then there exists some \( l ^ \prime \in \mathbb{ N } _ 0 \) such that \( l ^ \prime \gt l \) such that \( P \left( l ^ \prime  \right)  \). Now consider the new predicate defined by \( Q \left( n \right) := P \left( l ^ \prime  - n  \right)  \), note that if \( Q \left( n \right)  \) holds true for values \( \left\{ l ^ \prime , l ^ \prime  - 1, \ldots 0 \right\}  \) then \( P \left( n \right)  \) holds true on the values \( \left\{ 0, \ldots l ^ \prime  \right\}  \) which is what we're trying to prove.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore we'll prove that \( Q \) holds on \( \left\{ 0, \ldots l ^ \prime  \right\}  \) via <a class="knowledge-link" href="/number_theory/induction.html#proposition-finite-induction">finite induction</a>. Note that \( Q \left( 0 \right)  \) holds true as it is \( P \left( l ^ \prime  - 0  \right) = P \left( l ^ \prime  \right)  \), let \( k \in \left\{ 0, \ldots , l ^ \prime  - 1 \right\}  \) and assume \( Q \left( k \right)  \) holds true, which is to say that \( P \left( l ^ \prime  - k \right)  \) is true, let's prove that \( Q \left( k + 1  \right)  \) holds true, which is to say that we must prove that \( P \left( l ^ \prime  - k - 1 \right)  \) holds true.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since \( l ^ \prime - k \ge l ^ \prime - \left( l ^ \prime  - 1 \right) = 1  \) then by the second property of \( P \) since we know that \( P \left( l ^ \prime  - k \right)  \) holds true, then we know that \( P \left( l ^ \prime - \left( k + 1  \right)  \right) = P \left( l ^ \prime  - k - 1 \right)   \) holds true, so that \( Q \left( k + 1  \right)  \) holds true, therefore by finite induction, see that \( Q \left( n \right)  \) holds on the set \( \left\{ 0, \ldots , l ^ \prime  \right\}  \) and therefore \( P \) holds on the set \( \left\{ 0, \ldots , l ^ \prime  \right\}  \) as well, which is what we were trying to show, and thus \( P \left( n \right)  \) holds true for all \( n \in \mathbb{ N } _ 0 \) .
